## **1. Overview**

### **Specification Cross-Check (Section 1)**

- This section is a product-summary section; normative technical detail is expanded and clause-traced in Sections 2-13.
- PAL/NTSC studio-signal scope aligns with [ITU-R BT.1700](../analogue-video-specifications/docs/video_formats/BT-1700-E/BT-1700-E.md) (Scope and Part A/Part B) and [SMPTE 170M-2004](../analogue-video-specifications/docs/video_formats/SMPTE-170M-2004/SMPTE-170M-2004.md) §1.1.
- Laserdisc feature scope aligns with [IEC 60856](../analogue-video-specifications/docs/laserdisc/IEC-60856-1986-Laservision-PAL/IEC-60856-1986-Laservision-PAL.md) §9.1/§10 and [IEC 60857](../analogue-video-specifications/docs/laserdisc/IEC-60857-1986-Laservision-NTSC/IEC-60857-1986-Laservision-NTSC.md) §9.1/§10.
- VITC scope aligns with [IEC 60461:2010](../analogue-video-specifications/docs/video_metadata/IEC-60461-2010-Time-and-control-code/IEC-60461-2010-Time-and-control-code.md) Clause 9 (vertical interval application).

### **Purpose**

**VideoSynth** is a **C++17 application** designed to generate **PAL or NTSC video signals** in the **CVBS file format**. It adheres closely to the **analogue video standards** and is built for **video engineers and media preservation professionals**.

### **Key Features**

- **Time-based signal generation** for PAL and NTSC, closely following analogue standards.
- Support for multiple sample rates: **4fsc**, **20MSPS**, **40MSPS**, or custom.
- **Frame-based content** from:
  - Progressive sources from constrained, validated file profiles (MKV/EXR).
- **Line-based injections** for VBI content:
  - **VITS** (Vertical Interval Test Signals).
  - **Laserdisc biphase encoding** (IEC 60856/60857).
  - **VITC** (Vertical Interval Timecode, SMPTE 12M).
- **Per-section noise injection**: two-component Gaussian noise model (floor + proportional) targeting orc-gui Black PSNR and White SNR metrics.
- **Per-section dropout injection**: physical-tape and optical-disc dropout simulation (random surface dropouts and persistent scratch dropouts) with automatic sidecar generation conformant to the [Dropout Extension Format](../cvbs-file-format-specification/docs/extensions/dropout-extension-format.md) (schema version 5).
- **Disc skip simulation**: Frame-accurate simulation of laserdisc player tracking failures. Forward skips discard disc frames from output; backward skips repeat frames as bit-identical copies (noise and dropout included), ensuring burst phase and colour-frame index remain consistent across all capture sources regardless of skip pattern.

### **Target Users**

- Video engineers.
- Video media preservation developers and engineers.

### **Implementation Details**

- **Language**: C++17.
- **Build System**: Nix.
- **Logging**: [spdlog](https://github.com/gabime/spdlog).
- **Sample Rate Conversion**: [soxr](https://sourceforge.net/p/soxr/).

## **2. Core Requirements**

### **Specification Cross-Check (Section 2)**

- `525`/`625` lines per frame and nominal field rates are sourced from [ITU-R BT.470-6](../analogue-video-specifications/docs/video_formats/BT-470-6-1998/BT-470-6-1998.md), Annex 1, Table 1 (items 1-2), and [SMPTE 170M-2004](../analogue-video-specifications/docs/video_formats/SMPTE-170M-2004/SMPTE-170M-2004.md) §1.1 and §11.3.

- PAL subcarrier `4.43361875 MHz` is sourced from [ITU-R BT.470-6](../analogue-video-specifications/docs/video_formats/BT-470-6-1998/BT-470-6-1998.md), Table 2 item 2.11(a).

### **Supported Standards**

All timing, signal levels, and encoding parameters for **PAL** and **NTSC** are defined in the following specifications:

- [ITU-R BT.470-6](../analogue-video-specifications/docs/video_formats/BT-470-6-1998/BT-470-6-1998.md): Conventional Television Systems.
- [ITU-R BT.1700](../analogue-video-specifications/docs/video_formats/BT-1700-E/BT-1700-E.md): Composite Video Signal Characteristics.
- [SMPTE 170M-2004](../analogue-video-specifications/docs/video_formats/SMPTE-170M-2004/SMPTE-170M-2004.md): Composite Analog Video Signal for NTSC.
- [SMPTE 244M-2003](../analogue-video-specifications/docs/video_formats/SMPTE-244M-2003/SMPTE-244M-2003.md): Bit-Parallel Digital Interface for NTSC.
- [EBU Tech. 3280-E](../analogue-video-specifications/docs/video_formats/EBU-Tech-3280-E/EBU-Tech-3280-E.md): 625-Line Digital PAL Interfaces.

### **PAL/NTSC Variant Scope (Normative for this Specification)**

To avoid ambiguity, this specification uses **PAL** and **NTSC** with the following fixed meanings:

- **PAL** means the **625/50 PAL family with 4.43361875 MHz subcarrier** (PAL-B/G/H/I timing family in baseband composite terms).
- **NTSC** means **NTSC-M 525/59.94 with 3.579545 MHz subcarrier** as defined by SMPTE 170M.

The following are **out of scope** for this specification unless explicitly added in a future revision:

- PAL-N, PAL-60, NTSC 4.43, SECAM, and other non-625/50-PAL or non-NTSC-M variants (PAL-M — 525/59.94 with the System M line structure and 3.575611 MHz subcarrier — **is** supported).
- RF transmission/channel-plan differences (for example PAL-I RF sound spacing), because this document defines **baseband CVBS generation** rather than broadcast RF modulation.

Practical interpretation:

- If a user asks for "PAL-I", VideoSynth uses the same baseband 625/50 PAL composite timing and levels defined here; PAL-I-specific RF-layer differences are not modeled.


| **Standard** | **Accepted Frame-Based Source Dimensions** | **Frame Rate** | **Field Rate** | **Colour Subcarrier** | **Lines/Frame** | **Reference**   |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------------- | -------------- | -------------- | --------------------- | --------------- | --------------- |
| PAL (625/50 family) | 720x576 | 25 fps         | 50 Hz          | 4.43361875 MHz        | 625             | ITU-R BT.470-6  |
| NTSC-M (525/59.94)  | 720x486 | ~29.97 fps     | ~59.94 Hz      | 3.579545 MHz          | 525             | SMPTE 170M-2004 |

For file-based frame sources, ingestion is strict and fail-closed: only the exact supported raster for the selected standard is accepted.


### **Output Modes**

Current implementation status:

- **Locked**: Implemented. The runtime requires `signal_state_preset: STANDARD_TBC_LOCKED`.
- **Unlocked**: Target design only; not implemented in the current runtime.

### **Sample Rates**


Current implementation status:

- **4fsc**: Implemented for PAL and NTSC.
- **20MSPS / 40MSPS / Custom**: Design targets only; not implemented in the current runtime.
- The current validator and output path accept `CVBS_U10_4FSC`, `CVBS_U16_4FSC`, `CVBS_TPG21_4FSC`, `RAW_S16_28M`, and `RAW_S16_40M`. The 4fsc encodings remain locked to the 4fsc lattice, while raw encodings are resampled by the output stage.


| **Sample Rate** | **PAL (Hz)** | **NTSC (Hz)** | **Notes**                        |
| --------------- | ------------ | ------------- | -------------------------------- |
| 4fsc            | 17,734,475   | 14,318,180    | Locked to subcarrier (optional). |
| 20MSPS          | 20,000,000   | 20,000,000    | Oversampling.                    |
| 40MSPS          | 40,000,000   | 40,000,000    | Oversampling.                    |
| Custom          | User-defined | User-defined  | Must be > 4fsc.                  |

At `4fsc`, NTSC frame cadence is orthogonal (`910 x 525 = 477,750` samples/frame). PAL is non-orthogonal at `4fsc` and uses `709,379` samples/frame via a distributed one-sample slip pattern (`1135` nominal samples/line with four lines per frame at `1134`).

## **3. Architecture Overview**

### **Specification Cross-Check (Section 3)**

- The current implementation uses a sampled-domain split: frame-scoped CVBS-domain Y/C synthesis directly on the `4fsc` lattice, followed by composite quantisation and file output. This remains consistent with composite-signal decomposition in [SMPTE 170M-2004](../analogue-video-specifications/docs/video_formats/SMPTE-170M-2004/SMPTE-170M-2004.md) §3, §7-§10 and [ITU-R BT.1700](../analogue-video-specifications/docs/video_formats/BT-1700-E/BT-1700-E.md) Part A/Part B, but it is not a continuous-time then sampled split.
- Independent luma/chroma generation with later composition maps to luminance/chrominance model definitions in [SMPTE 170M-2004](../analogue-video-specifications/docs/video_formats/SMPTE-170M-2004/SMPTE-170M-2004.md) §6-§10 and [ITU-R BT.470-6](../analogue-video-specifications/docs/video_formats/BT-470-6-1998/BT-470-6-1998.md), Table 2 item 2.5.

VideoSynth currently follows a **four-stage sampled-domain architecture**:

1. **[Generation Stage](#generation-stage)**: Synthesizes **4fsc-discrete fixed-point mV representations** of **luma (Y)** and **chroma (C)** for complete frame batches.
2. **Noise Injection Stage** (`NoiseInjectionStage`): Applies optional per-section two-component Gaussian noise to the fixed-point mV Y/C buffers before quantisation, targeting orc-gui Black PSNR and White SNR metrics.
3. **Dropout Injection Stage** (`DropoutInjectionStage`): Applies optional per-section random and scratch dropout events to the fixed-point mV Y/C buffers after noise, and writes a conformant SQLite dropout sidecar (`<basename>.dropouts.meta`).
4. **[Output Stage](#output-stage)**: Validates frame-span alignment, combines Y and C, quantises to the active digital interface code space, and formats the final CVBS output files.

Alongside these four stages, an optional **Audio Track Generator** (`AudioTrackGenerator`) runs when at least one section declares an `audio:` channel pair. It synthesises per-channel test-tone waveforms (`AudioSynthesizer`) frame-locked to the video and streams one stereo 24-bit PCM RIFF/WAVE track per declared channel pair (0–7) to `<basename>_audio_<pair>.wav` (each via an `AudioWavWriter`). Audio is a pure function of output position, so the generator is driven with the output-order section sequence and stays sample-accurately aligned to the stored video frames under disc-skip withhold/replay. See [Section 7 `audio:`](#audio-sub-key-optional-per-section).

When `output.efm_audio` selects one of those channel pairs, the same generator additionally synthesises that pair at 44 100 Hz and streams it through the `videosynth_efm` module (`AudioEfmWriter`) as a LaserDisc digital audio EFM channel stream written to `<basename>.efm` with its own `<basename>.efm.meta` sidecar. The pair's 48 kHz WAV track is unaffected. See [LaserDisc Digital Audio (EFM) Output](#laserdisc-digital-audio-efm-output).

### **Key Principles**

- **Independent Y and C Generation**: Luma and chroma are generated separately and combined only at the output stage.
- **Sampled-Domain Generation**: Signals are synthesized directly on the locked `4fsc` sample lattice using analogue-derived timing and level parameters.
- **Analogue Parameterization in the Digital Domain**: Pulse widths, burst placement, signal levels, and active-picture apertures are derived from PAL/NTSC analogue specifications but realized directly as digital sample sequences.
- **Analogue Compliance**: Strict adherence to PAL/NTSC standards for timing, sync pulses, and colour encoding.
- **Noise After Generation**: Noise is injected after the generation stage and before quantisation, so all synthesised regions (VBI lines, active picture, blanking) receive noise and it is preserved in the final 10-bit output codes.

## **4. Generation Stage**

### **Specification Cross-Check (Section 4)**

- BT.601 source-domain assumptions (YCbCr construction/quantization and studio swing conventions) are grounded in [BT.601-5](../analogue-video-specifications/docs/video_formats/BT-601-5-1995/BT-601-5-1995.md) §3.5.1-§3.5.4 and Part A tables for 4:4:4 coding.
- NTSC colour encoding/filtering references are grounded in [SMPTE 170M-2004](../analogue-video-specifications/docs/video_formats/SMPTE-170M-2004/SMPTE-170M-2004.md) §6 (matrices), §7 (filtering), §8 (subcarrier modulation).
- PAL chroma sideband limits used for encoder bandwidth targets are grounded in [ITU-R BT.470-6](../analogue-video-specifications/docs/video_formats/BT-470-6-1998/BT-470-6-1998.md), Table 2 item 2.12.
- Sync/burst insertion basis is grounded in [ITU-R BT.1700](../analogue-video-specifications/docs/video_formats/BT-1700-E/BT-1700-E.md), Table 2/Table 3 and Figures 1-9, plus [SMPTE 170M-2004](../analogue-video-specifications/docs/video_formats/SMPTE-170M-2004/SMPTE-170M-2004.md) §13.
- PAL pilot burst and NTSC VBI-burst behavior are grounded in [IEC 60856](../analogue-video-specifications/docs/laserdisc/IEC-60856-1986-Laservision-PAL/IEC-60856-1986-Laservision-PAL.md) §9.1.2 and [IEC 60857](../analogue-video-specifications/docs/laserdisc/IEC-60857-1986-Laservision-NTSC/IEC-60857-1986-Laservision-NTSC.md) §9.1.2.

### **Key Principle: Frame-Based Generation**

**All generation is frame-scoped.** A frame (two sequential fields) is the **smallest synthesis unit** in the generation stage, and frames are emitted downstream in bounded frame batches for streaming output.

However, **line timing and source-row addressing inside that frame are field-aware by definition**. This is required to keep interlaced field sequence and active-picture placement compliant with the NTSC/PAL timing models.

For avoidance of doubt, the generator shall apply the following rules:

- **NTSC active-picture line starts (1-indexed frame lines):** field 1 starts at line **22**; field 2 starts at line **284**. Line 21 (field-1 transition) and line 283 (field-2 transition) are not treated as full active-picture lines.
- **PAL active-picture line starts (1-indexed frame lines):** field 1 starts at line **23**; field 2 starts at line **335**.
- **Progressive-to-interlaced row mapping:** for a field-local active line index $n$ (starting at 0), field 1 samples source row $2n+1$ and field 2 samples source row $2n$.

Frame-source raster preservation contract (normative):

- Progressive file sources must be `720x576` for PAL or `720x486` for NTSC.
- The internal frame-source working raster remains fixed at `720x576` for PAL and `720x486` for NTSC.
- Asset compliance for progressive sources is defined by [EXR BT.601 Compliance Requirements](../../videosynth-assets/docs/exr-bt601-compliance-requirements.md) and [MKV BT.601 Compliance Requirements](../../videosynth-assets/docs/mkv-bt601-compliance-requirements.md). Section 8.1 is required to stay aligned with those documents.
- Progressive ingestion is strict passthrough in raster geometry: no decode-time scaling, no resampling, no implicit aspect-ratio remapping, no horizontal crop, no vertical crop, and no implicit active-window extraction.
- The full source raster is preserved sample-for-sample at ingestion, including BT.601-related horizontal placement and padding semantics.
- For avoidance of doubt, this includes preserving all progressive source lines (`576` for PAL, `486` for NTSC) and preserving line width at `720` samples.
- Normative progressive-source profile expectations for the preserved `720`-sample line are:
  - **PAL (`720x576`)**: expected sample-aspect ratio is **`128:117`**; expected horizontal digital padding model is **`8-704-8`**.
  - **NTSC (`720x486`)**: expected sample-aspect ratio is **`108:119`**; expected horizontal digital padding model is **`8-704-8`**.
  - These are source-profile expectations, not runtime crop/remap instructions. Runtime ingestion preserves the input raster and padding layout exactly as delivered when the source passes profile validation.
- PAL analogue reference derivation (timing interpretation only; not an ingestion crop rule):
  - ITU-R BT.1700 Table 1 item `1a`: `576` active lines.
  - ITU-R BT.1700 Table 2: `64.0 us` line period and `12.0 us` line blanking, giving `52.0 us` analogue active line duration.
  - Under the shared ITU-R BT.601 `13.5 MHz` digital sampling model, `52.0 us * 13.5 MHz = 702` visible pixels.
  - The `720`-sample frame-source raster therefore has `18` non-visible horizontal samples, which split evenly into `9` samples of left margin and `9` samples of right margin.
  - The PAL frame-source visible aperture is therefore a centered `702x576` region at `x=9..710`, `y=0..575`.
- NTSC analogue reference derivation (timing interpretation only; not an ingestion crop rule):
  - SMPTE 170M-2004 analogue timing yields an active picture interval of approximately `52.666 us`.
  - Under the shared ITU-R BT.601 `13.5 MHz` digital sampling model, `52.666 us * 13.5 MHz = 711` visible pixels.
  - The `720`-sample frame-source raster therefore has `9` non-visible horizontal samples. Because that remainder is odd, the nearest centered integer placement is `4` samples of left margin and `5` samples of right margin.
  - The NTSC frame-source timing model yields a near-centered `711`-sample horizontal active interpretation at `x=4..714` within the `720`-sample source raster.
  - Progressive ingestion still preserves the full `720x486` source raster and does not crop any source lines.

### **Progressive Horizontal Mapping to 4fsc Active Samples (Normative)**

To preserve deterministic `4fsc` behavior from progressive inputs, horizontal mapping from frame-source pixels to active-line `4fsc` samples is defined as an exact integer-domain rule.

Definitions:

- Let $N_a$ be the number of active-line samples in the selected standard's `4fsc` active window.
- Let $W$ be the active source width used for mapping (`720` in the current runtime).
- Let $s \in [0, N_a-1]$ be the active-line sample index.
- Let $p(s)$ be the mapped source pixel index.

Normative mapping equation:

$$
p(s) = \left\lfloor \frac{s \cdot W}{N_a} \right\rfloor
$$

This mapping is mandatory for progressive-source ingestion in the generation stage.

Per-standard active-sample counts used by this mapping in current `4fsc` runtime:

- PAL: $N_a = \operatorname{round}(17{,}734{,}475 \times 52.0\,\mu s) = 922$
- NTSC: $N_a = \operatorname{round}(14{,}318{,}180 \times 52.0\,\mu s) = 745$

Properties required by this mapping:

- Every active sample maps to exactly one source pixel.
- The first and last active samples map exactly to the first and last pixels of the active source window.
- Every source active pixel maps to one or more active samples (no dropped source pixels).
- Mapping is deterministic and purely integer-domain (no floating-point coordinate interpolation in the mapping rule).

Equivalent per-pixel sample-span form (for reasoning and tests):

$$
s_{start}(i) = \left\lceil \frac{i \cdot N_a}{W} \right\rceil, \quad
s_{end}(i) = \left\lceil \frac{(i+1) \cdot N_a}{W} \right\rceil - 1
$$

for $i \in [0, W-1]$.

Practical width handling:

- Progressive sources use fixed-width mapping with $W=720$.

This rule applies identically to PAL and NTSC; only $N_a$ differs by standard.

The progressive source ingestion stage remains responsible for decoding and colour-space normalisation, but the generation stage is responsible for preserving the correct field sequence geometry when mapping normalised frame data into line-timed CVBS-domain Y/C waveforms.

---

### **Source Colour Space Requirement**

**All frame-based sources must provide pixel data to the chroma encoder in the following representation:**

> **10-bit 4:4:4 YCbCr, BT.601 studio swing**
> - Y: 64–940 (black–white)
> - Cb, Cr: 64–960 (midpoint 512)

This is a hard interface contract. The chroma encoder assumes this representation unconditionally and does not perform any colour space conversion internally. The rationale for 4:4:4 (rather than 4:2:2) is that the encoder must apply its own standard-compliant bandlimiting filters to the chroma channels before quadrature modulation. In the current implementation, PAL applies a symmetric low-pass filter of approximately 1.3 MHz on U and V before modulation, and NTSC applies a symmetric low-pass filter of approximately 1.2 MHz on Cb and Cr before modulation. Receiving pre-subsampled chroma would prevent deterministic filtering at the encoder boundary and would introduce chroma siting ambiguity that is incompatible with subcarrier-locked sampling at 4fsc.

### **PAL Chroma Encoding Model**

The PAL chroma path in this specification is normative for the implementation and follows [ITU-R BT.1700](../analogue-video-specifications/docs/video_formats/BT-1700-E/BT-1700-E.md), Annex 1 Part B, Table 1 items 10d/10f/10h and Figure 8, plus [EBU Tech. 3280-E](../analogue-video-specifications/docs/video_formats/EBU-Tech-3280-E/EBU-Tech-3280-E.md) §1.1.1/§1.2.

- PAL active chroma is synthesized as:

$$
E_M' = E_Y' + E_U'\sin(\omega t) + E_V'\cos(\omega t)
$$

- The PAL V-switch is applied by inverting the V axis on lines where the burst polarity sequence requires negative burst phase. This is sequence-aware and is not modeled as a simple global odd/even toggle.
- PAL burst phase uses the BT.1700 sequence map (I/II/III/IV across colour fields) with nominal burst phases of $+135^\circ$ and $-135^\circ$ per Table 1 item 10f.
- PAL burst suppression in the vertical interval follows BT.1700 Figure 8. The four 9-line blanking windows (I: 623–006, II: 310–318, III: 622–005, IV: 311–319) are defined in frame-line numbers and span frame boundaries, so they are applied per colour-frame parity: even-parity disc frames (fields I/II) blank lines 1–6, 310–318, and 622–625; odd-parity frames (fields III/IV) blank lines 1–5, 311–319, and 623–625. The alternation of the meander edge lines (6, 310, 319, 622) is what allows decoders (e.g. ld-decode/decode-orc) to identify the 4-field position of the 8-field sequence. PAL-M applies the corresponding 11-line windows of Figure 9 (I: 523–008, II: 260–270, III: 522–007, IV: 259–269) in the same parity-keyed manner.
- PAL subcarrier phase progression is continuous across the full frame sample timeline (non-orthogonal 4fsc lattice per EBU Tech. 3280-E, 709 379 samples/frame), and active-picture chroma uses the same sequence model as burst. Because 709 379 ≡ 3 (mod 4), the subcarrier-to-frame phase rotates by 270° per frame, producing the 4-frame (8-field) colour sequence.
- The 625-line PAL subcarrier lattice is rotated by a fixed 270° anchor so that disc frame 0 (meander parity 0, carrying fields I/II) presents the subcarrier-to-frame phase of colour fields 1/2. This pairing was validated against the ld-decode/decode-orc field-phase detection: without the anchor, the two fields of a frame decode as non-consecutive field IDs. PAL-M uses a zero anchor.

### **NTSC Chroma Encoding Model**

The NTSC chroma path in this specification is normative for the implementation and follows [SMPTE 170M-2004](../analogue-video-specifications/docs/video_formats/SMPTE-170M-2004/SMPTE-170M-2004.md) §8/§10/§13 together with [SMPTE 244M-2003](../analogue-video-specifications/docs/video_formats/SMPTE-244M-2003/SMPTE-244M-2003.md) §3.1/§4.1.1/§4.1.2.

- NTSC active chroma is synthesized as:

$$
E_M' = E_Y' + E_{Cb}'\sin(\theta) + E_{Cr}'\cos(\theta)
$$

- In the implementation, the active-picture NTSC phase reference uses burst plus $180^\circ$ (SMPTE 170M §10 convention), i.e.:

$$
	heta = \omega t + \varphi_{\text{burst,line}} + \varphi_{\text{frame}} + \pi
$$

- Line-to-line NTSC burst phase alternates at 4fsc because 910 samples/line corresponds to a $\pi$ radian subcarrier phase advance per line (SMPTE 244M §4.1.1 interpretation in this model).
- The NTSC colour sequence is modeled as a 2-frame SC-H progression using a frame phase offset of $0$ then $\pi$, repeating (SMPTE 170M field/frame color-sequence behavior).
- In baseline mode, burst is present on horizontal lines and suppressed on equalizing/broad-sync lines; when NTSC laserdisc VBI burst mode is enabled, burst is additionally inserted on equalizing and broad-sync pulses per [IEC 60857](../analogue-video-specifications/docs/laserdisc/IEC-60857-1986-Laservision-NTSC/IEC-60857-1986-Laservision-NTSC.md) §9.1.2.

**Progressive sources** are converted during ingestion by `progressive_source`, but only when they match one of the supported source profiles defined in [Section 8.1](#81-frame-based-sections). Inputs that do not match a supported profile are invalid.

All accepted progressive inputs are normalized to **10-bit 4:4:4 YCbCr BT.601 studio swing** before frame data is passed to the generator. The conversion path uses source metadata (primaries, transfer, matrix, range) when present.

Source-range capability note:

- **MKV and EXR supported profiles** are required to preserve 10-bit studio-domain detail, including below-black and above-white code excursions when present in the source.

### **Frame Template Cache and Per-Frame Patches**

Per-frame synthesis is split into a **clean frame template** and a set of **per-frame patches** (`GenerationStage::SynthesiseTemplate`, `src/generation_stage.cpp`):

- The **template** carries everything that is invariant for a given source frame within one colour sequence period: the sync/blanking skeleton, colour burst (including PAL burst blanking and V-switch), the PAL LaserDisc pilot burst, the active picture, and the project-wide VITS lines.
- The **patches** are the things that genuinely vary per output frame — Laserdisc VBI waveforms (biphase/FM/white flag) and OSD text — applied to a copy of the template and touching only their own lines and samples. Noise and dropout injection run downstream in their own stages, also per frame.

**Periodicity.** For identical source content the clean frame is an exact function of `(source, source_frame_index, disc_frame_index mod P)`:

- The subcarrier advances exactly π/2 per 4fsc sample, so its phase depends only on `absolute_sample_index mod 4`. Samples per frame mod 4 is 3 for PAL (709,379), 1 for PAL-M (477,225) and 2 for NTSC (477,750), giving a lattice period of 4, 4, and 2 frames respectively.
- The PAL/PAL-M burst-blanking meander and V-switch have period 2 frames, which divides 4.
- The PAL LaserDisc pilot burst is period 1 (17,734,475 pilot cycles = 25 × 709,379 samples).

Hence **P = 4 frames for PAL and PAL-M, and P = 2 frames for NTSC**; a still section contains only P distinct clean frames, and an MKV `duration_repeat` section contains at most P × clip_length. Synthesis reduces `disc_frame_index` to this residue (`sequence_phase`) before deriving any phase, which is exact — every use of the index inside clean synthesis depends only on the residue — so the split does not change output bits.

**Cache.** `GenerationStage` shares clean templates between worker threads through a bounded `TemplateCache`:

- **Key**: `(source path, section type, source frame identity, sequence_phase)`. Sections sharing a source share templates, and a still (`.exr`) source collapses every schedule position onto one identity because its decoder returns the same image for every frame index. Everything else the template depends on — the CVBS presets and the project VITS set — is held as the cache configuration, and a lookup against a different configuration clears the cache. `BuildFrameSchedule` also clears it, alongside the decoded-source cache.
- **Admission on second request**: a key's first request returns "synthesise directly" and only a repeated request builds and stores the template. A clip source played once produces every key exactly once and therefore bypasses the cache entirely, instead of filling it with templates nothing will ever read; still frames, `duration_repeat` passes, and disc-skip replays revisit their keys and are admitted from the second request on.
- **Concurrency**: the lookup table is mutex-guarded and each entry is built exactly once under a per-key `std::once_flag` (single-flight); concurrent requests for the same key wait for that one build while other keys proceed. Published templates are immutable `shared_ptr`-to-const data.
- **Sizing**: entries are admitted until a configurable byte capacity (default 512 MiB, ~45 PAL templates; CLI `--template-cache-mb`, 0 disables) and never evicted; once the cache is full, further misses synthesise directly into the output buffer. Sources with more distinct frames than the cache can hold therefore degrade to the uncached path instead of thrashing.
- **Determinism**: output is byte-identical with the cache enabled, disabled, or capped at any size, and across thread counts — a cache hit is a copy of data produced by the same `SynthesiseTemplate` function the direct path runs.

### **Decoded Source Cache and Prefetch**

Decoded source images are held by `ProgressiveFrameSource` in a small
most-recently-used table (at most three sources: the section being rendered,
the previous section a straddling worker may still be finishing, and a section
decoded ahead of time). Images are immutable and delivered as
`shared_ptr<const FrameSourceImage>`, so delivery costs a reference count and a
frame stays valid after its entry is evicted.

The table lock is held only for the lookup; each entry carries its own lock,
held across that entry's decode. Two requests for the same source therefore
share one decode, while decoding one source never blocks requests for another.

That separation is what makes **prefetching** useful. `BuildFrameSchedule`
records, for each section, the source the next section will read; when
synthesis reaches the first frame of a section run, it asks the frame source to
decode the next section's source on a background thread
(`ProgressiveFrameSource::PrefetchSection`). A section-start decode — an EXR
convert, or a whole-clip `ffmpeg` decode — otherwise stalls every worker at the
boundary. Prefetch failures are ignored: the frame request that follows repeats
the decode and reports the error, so the prefetch changes only when work
happens, never what is produced. Hand-built schedules carry no such mapping and
simply do not prefetch.

### **OSD (On-Screen Display) Sub-system**

The `OsdRenderer` class writes monochrome bitmap-font text overlays into the luma sample buffer of an active video frame.  It is invoked as the final step of per-frame generation, after active video content and biphase injection, so that burn-in tokens have access to the current-frame biphase context.

**Data model** (defined in `model.h`):

- `OsdOverlay` — one text string (literal or token template), active-area pixel position (`x`, `y`), glyph scale factor (`scale` in [1, 4]), foreground level (`fg_level`, one of four discrete luma steps: `white` = 1.0, `light_grey` = 0.75, `dark_grey` = 0.25, `black` = 0.0), and background level (`bg_level`, the same four steps plus `transparent` = no background write; default `transparent`).
- `OsdConfig` — a list of zero or more `OsdOverlay` objects per section.  Stored as `Section::osd`.

**Rendering** (`OsdRenderer`, `src/osd_renderer.cpp`):

- Uses a static 96-glyph 8×8 pixel bitmap font (`src/osd_font.h`) covering printable ASCII 0x20–0x7F, derived from the IBM PC BIOS 8×8 VGA font.
- Each glyph pixel is rendered as a `scale` × `scale` output block.
- Only the luma channel is written; the chroma channel is unchanged (monochrome overlay).
- Pixels outside `[active_sample_start, active_sample_end)` or `[active_line_start, active_line_end)` are silently clipped.
- Token resolution is done by `OsdTokenResolver` (`include/videosynth/osd_token_resolver.h`) before passing `resolved_texts` to `Render()`.

**Token resolution** (`OsdTokenResolver`, `src/osd_token_resolver.cpp`):

- `{picture_number}` — zero-padded 5-digit CAV picture number from `PerFrameContext` (IEC 60856/60857 max 99999); `"00000"` when 0.
- `{biphase_hex}` — space-separated 6-digit uppercase hex biphase code words; `"000000"` when empty.
- `{phase_id}` — colour-frame sequence index (0–3 PAL, 0–1 NTSC).
- `{section_name}` — the section `name:` field verbatim.
- `{timecode}` — CLV programme timecode `HH:MM:SS:FF`, computed from the 0-based sequential output frame position at the standard's CLV frame rate (`ClvTimecodeForFrame`, 25 fps PAL / 30 fps NTSC); runs continuously from the start of the output on any CLV disc, independent of which VBI codes a section injects. `"00:00:00:00"` on non-CLV discs.
- `{frame_number}` — 1-based sequential position of the frame in the whole generated output, zero-padded to 5 digits; set from the schedule index in `GenerationStage`, never re-anchored by a section.
- Unavailable values render as all-zero fields with the same width as a real value, so overlay layout never shifts.
- Unknown token names are rejected at project-validation time by `HasOnlyKnownTokens()`; static text with no tokens passes through unchanged.

**Per-frame VBI context** (`PerFrameContext`, `include/videosynth/biphase_injection_manager.h`):

- Captured by `BiphaseInjectionManager::ProcessFrame()` before advancing generators.
- Exposed via `GetLastFrameContext()` for use by token resolver immediately after injection.
- Reset to defaults by `Reset()`.

**Pipeline wiring** (`GenerationStage`, `src/generation_stage.cpp`):

- OSD rendering executes after `biphase_manager_.ProcessFrame()` for each frame.
- Tokens are resolved from `biphase_manager_.GetLastFrameContext()`.
- `Render()` is called twice per frame — once for field 1 and once for field 2 — so overlays appear in both fields at the same y-offset within each field's active picture area.

**YAML** (`src/yaml_project_parser.cpp`): sections may include an `osd:` block with an `overlays:` list; each overlay supports `text`, `x`, `y`, `scale`, `fg_luma` (string enum: `white`, `light_grey`, `dark_grey`, or `black`), and `bg_luma` (string enum: `transparent`, `white`, `light_grey`, `dark_grey`, or `black`).

**Validation** (`src/project_validator.cpp`): `scale` ∈ [1, 4]; `fg_luma` must be one of `white`, `light_grey`, `dark_grey`, `black`; `bg_luma` must be one of `transparent`, `white`, `light_grey`, `dark_grey`, `black`; token names must be one of the four above.


### **Inputs**

- Frame-based content in **10-bit 4:4:4 YCbCr BT.601 studio swing** from normalised progressive sources.
- Line-based injections (VITS, Laserdisc biphase, VITC).
- CVBS presets (video_standard_preset, sample_encoding_preset, signal_state_preset, mode).

### **Outputs**

- `4fsc`-discrete **luma (Y)** and **chroma (C)** sample buffers as **high-resolution fixed-point mV values**, emitted as whole-frame batches (typically small bounded groups of frames) for handoff to the Noise Injection Stage and then to the Output Stage. Values are relative to blanking and are stored internally as signed integers scaled by $2^{20}$ before final quantisation.
- Metadata (field order, dominance, timing).

## **5. Output Stage**

### **Specification Cross-Check (Section 5)**

- 10-bit quantization and legal/protected code-space behavior are grounded in [EBU Tech. 3280-E](../analogue-video-specifications/docs/video_formats/EBU-Tech-3280-E/EBU-Tech-3280-E.md) §1.1.1/§1.1.2 and [SMPTE 244M-2003](../analogue-video-specifications/docs/video_formats/SMPTE-244M-2003/SMPTE-244M-2003.md) §3.3, §4.2.4, Table 1.
- NTSC 4fsc sample-phase alignment and clock/subcarrier relationship are grounded in [SMPTE 244M-2003](../analogue-video-specifications/docs/video_formats/SMPTE-244M-2003/SMPTE-244M-2003.md) §3.1 and §4.1.2.

### **Responsibilities**

| **Combining Y and C**   | Combine quantised luma and chroma into composite signal (CVBS), or write them to separate `.cvbsy`/`.cvbsc` files in Y/C mode. | CVBS File Format Specification    |
| **Output Formatting**   | Format the quantised composite signal into the output files (video and metadata).   | CVBS File Format Specification    |

### **CVBS File Output**

The output stage generates files as per the [CVBS File Format Specification](../cvbs-file-format-specification/docs/index.md). The output mode is controlled by `output.signal_type` in the project YAML:

**Composite output** (`signal_type: composite`, default):
1. **Video File** (`.cvbs`): Raw samples of the composite signal (Y + C + sync).
2. **Metadata File** (`.meta`): Header metadata (magic number, version, video standard preset, sample encoding preset, signal state preset, resolution, etc.).

**Dual-file Y/C output** (`signal_type: yc`):
1. **Luma File** (`.cvbsy`): Raw luma samples (Y + sync) encoded identically to composite luma.
2. **Chroma File** (`.cvbsc`): Raw chroma samples, centred at code 512 in the 10-bit domain as defined by the [CVBS File Format Specification — Sample Encoding Presets](../cvbs-file-format-specification/docs/sample-encoding-presets.md).
3. **Metadata File** (`.meta`): Header metadata, identical structure to composite output with `signal_type` set to `'yc'`.

For Y/C output, `output.video_path` must end in `.cvbsy`; the chroma path is derived by replacing the `.cvbsy` suffix with `.cvbsc`.

### **LaserDisc Digital Audio (EFM) Output**

A project may additionally emit the LaserDisc digital audio channel of one audio channel pair. The full design, including the specification mapping and the phased task breakdown, is in the [EFM Digital Audio Implementation Plan](efm-implementation-plan.md).

**Module boundary** — all EFM signal processing lives in a standalone static library `videosynth_efm` (`src/efm/`, `include/videosynth/efm/`, namespace `videosynth::efm`) that has **no dependency on `videosynth_core`**: its API takes 16-bit stereo PCM plus a track table and emits an EFM channel stream. `videosynth_core` links the module, not the reverse, so a decoder, data modes, or RF modulation can be added later without touching the audio subsystem. Its stages are:

| Stage | Responsibility | Reference |
|---|---|---|
| `AudioFrameAssembler` | Six 16-bit stereo samples → one 24-byte F1 frame (WmA = high byte, WmB = low byte) | IEC 60908-1999, 16.2 |
| `CircEncoder` | GF(2⁸) C2 (28,24) and C1 (32,28) Reed–Solomon parity with the CIRC delay/interleave structure and parity inversion | IEC 60908-1999, 16.3; ECMA-130 Annex C |
| `SubcodeGenerator` | 98-frame subcode sections at 75 Hz with S0/S1 sync, channel P, and Q-mode 4 (ADR = 0100) DATA-Q: lead-in TOC, per-track running/absolute time, lead-out | IEC 60908-1999, 17.3–17.5.1; IEC 60856:1986 Amd 2, 13.5; IEC 60857:1986 Amd 2, 13.6 |
| `EfmModulator` | Eight-to-fourteen coding, merging-bit selection (runs 3–11 channel bits, DSV minimised), 24-bit frame sync, 588-channel-bit frames | IEC 60908-1999, clauses 13–15; ECMA-130 Annex D/E |
| `EfmStreamEncoder` | The module's public facade: `Begin` / `PushSamples` / `Flush`, chaining the stages and exposing T-values | — |

**Output files** — the EFM extension is the two-file pair defined by the [EFM Extension Format](../cvbs-file-format-specification/docs/extensions/efm-extension-format.md): `<basename>.efm` holds the channel stream as one unsigned byte per pit/land run length (T3–T11), starting at the first frame sync, and `<basename>.efm.meta` is its own SQLite sidecar (schema version 1) carrying one `efm_frame` row per stored video frame — `cvbs_file_id`, `frame_id`, `t_value_offset` and `t_value_count`. Both share the CVBS basename, so the channel pair is not part of either name. `AudioEfmWriter` mirrors the `AudioWavWriter` streaming contract (`BeginWrite` / `AppendFrameAudio` / `FinalizeWrite` / `AbortWrite`), writing the sidecar on finalize, so an aborted run leaves neither file behind. No EFM metadata is written into the core `<basename>.meta` database: the core CVBS schema has no EFM concept, and the extension is self-describing.

**Sample timing** — the EFM path synthesises the selected pair independently at exactly 44 100 Hz (PAL 1764/625 × F_H, IEC 60856:1986 Amd 2, 13.2; NTSC 7007/2500 × F_H, IEC 60857:1986 Amd 2, 13.2) from the same `AudioParameters` as the 48 kHz WAV path — there is no resampling. Per video frame that is 1764 samples for PAL (exact) and the SMPTE 272M-1994 Table 1 sequence for NTSC (147147 samples per 100 frames). Samples are converted from 24-bit to the CD's 16-bit domain by rounding to nearest with saturation.

**Track layout** — every contiguous run of output frames sharing one `programme_area` section is one track, numbered 01, 02, … in output order (maximum 79 tracks). `lead_in` sections carry the repetitive mode-4 TOC (one POINT per track plus A0/A1/A2, with the video-system identification 22 = PAL / 12 = NTSC in the A0 P FRAME field), and `lead_out` sections carry lead-out subcode (TNO = AA). Track boundaries are placed on the nearest subcode section, so a boundary sits within 1/150 s of the video frame carrying the section change. The first 2 s of track 1 are the mandatory pause required by IEC 60908-1999, 17.5.1: digital silence in the EFM stream while the WAV track carries the section's tone.

**Timing alignment** — t = 0 is common to video frame 0, WAV sample 0, EFM source sample 0, and Q absolute time 00:00:00. The only structural delay is the CIRC interleave, exported as `kCircPipelineLatencyFrames = 108` (ECMA-130, C.9): a complementary decoder emits 108 F1 frames (648 stereo samples, ≈14.69 ms) of warm-up silence before source sample 0, after which decoded PCM is sample-exact against the 44.1 kHz source. The stream is **not** pre-compensated for that delay, so the shared datum with the video and WAV timelines holds.

### **Inputs**

- `4fsc`-discrete fixed-point Y and C signal buffers from the generation stage.
- CVBS presets (sample rate, subcarrier lock, endianness).

### **Outputs**

- **Video File**: Raw samples of the composite signal.
- **Metadata File**: Header metadata. EFM output adds no rows here; it carries its own `<basename>.efm.meta` sidecar.

### **6.1. Signal Levels**

All signal levels within VideoSynth are expressed in **millivolts (mV)**, measured relative to **blanking level (0 mV)**. IRE units are used in NTSC engineering documentation but are **not used internally by the generator**; they are defined here solely for reference when reading NTSC standards.

#### **PAL Signal Levels**

PAL uses mV natively. All PAL standard documents and the VITS definitions in this repository use mV.

| **Level**       | **mV (relative to blanking)** | **Description**                     |
| --------------- | ----------------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| Sync tip        | −300 mV                       | Bottom of sync pulse.               |
| Blanking        | 0 mV                          | Reference level for active video.   |
| Black           | 0 mV                          | Black level (same as blanking, PAL).|
| White           | 700 mV                        | 100% white (luminance peak).        |
| Composite peak  | 933 mV                        | Approximate peak including chroma.  |

The full PAL composite signal swings from −300 mV (sync tip) to approximately +933 mV (peak chroma), for a total composite amplitude of ~1233 mV. The **luminance range is 0–700 mV**.

#### **NTSC Signal Levels and IRE Conversion**

NTSC documentation traditionally uses **IRE units** (Institute of Radio Engineers). The generator does not use IRE internally; all NTSC levels are converted to mV for processing.

The IRE scale is defined relative to blanking:

| **Level**       | **IRE** | **mV (relative to blanking)** | **Description**                      |
| --------------- | ------- | ----------------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| Sync tip        | −40 IRE | −285.7 mV                     | Bottom of sync pulse.                |
| Blanking        | 0 IRE   | 0 mV                          | Reference level for active video.    |
| Black           | 7.5 IRE | 53.6 mV                       | Set-up (pedestal), used in NTSC USA. |
| White           | 100 IRE | 714.3 mV                      | 100% white (luminance peak).         |

VideoSynth supports an NTSC-specific black-level parameter under the NTSC-M timing model:

- **Standard NTSC setup**: black at **7.5 IRE** (`53.6 mV` above blanking).
- **Optional 0 IRE setup**: black at **0 IRE** (`0 mV`, equal to blanking). This matches the black-level convention often associated with NTSC-J usage, but in VideoSynth it is exposed only as a black-level parameter and does not define a separate video format.

This option affects **black reference and luma mapping only**. It does **not** change NTSC line timing, field cadence, sync amplitudes, burst behavior, subcarrier frequency, or 4fsc sample-rate rules.

**Conversion formula** (IRE ↔ mV, both relative to blanking):

$$\text{mV} = \text{IRE} \times 7.143$$
$$\text{IRE} = \frac{\text{mV}}{7.143}$$

This derives from the NTSC definition that 100 IRE = 714.3 mV (the luminance range from blanking to white).

> **Important**: PAL white (700 mV) and NTSC white (100 IRE = 714.3 mV) are **not the same level**. They must not be used interchangeably. The generator applies the correct levels for each standard independently.

#### **Summary Comparison**

| **Level**   | **PAL (mV)** | **NTSC standard (mV / IRE)** | **NTSC 0 IRE option (mV / IRE)** |
| ----------- | ------------ | ----------------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| Sync tip    | −300 mV      | −285.7 mV / −40 IRE          | −285.7 mV / −40 IRE              |
| Blanking    | 0 mV         | 0 mV / 0 IRE                 | 0 mV / 0 IRE                     |
| Black       | 0 mV         | 53.6 mV / 7.5 IRE            | 0 mV / 0 IRE                     |
| White       | 700 mV       | 714.3 mV / 100 IRE           | 714.3 mV / 100 IRE               |

#### **Internal Fixed-Point Representation**

The generator uses **signed fixed-point millivolt buffers** to represent all signal levels internally. The runtime path now stores Y and C samples in a high-resolution integer domain (Q20.12-style scaling in the implementation) so the generation stage and output stage can stay deterministic without carrying a floating-point representation.

**Why fixed-point is sufficient:**  
Certain signal additions push levels well outside the nominal PAL or NTSC signal range. The most significant case is the **PAL Laserdisc pilot burst** ([IEC 60856](../analogue-video-specifications/docs/laserdisc/IEC-60856-1986-Laservision-PAL/IEC-60856-1986-Laservision-PAL.md) §9.1.2), which is superimposed on the sync pulse at 3.75 MHz with a peak-to-peak amplitude of $\frac{6}{7} \times 700\ \text{mV} = 600\ \text{mV p-p}$. Centred on sync tip level (−300 mV), this burst swings between **−600 mV and 0 mV** — 300 mV below the standard sync tip. The fixed-point domain retains this headroom while still avoiding floating-point state in the runtime pipeline.

**Required internal headroom:**

| **Boundary**       | **Minimum range required** | **Driven by**                                          |
| ------------------ | -------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| Negative (below blanking) | ≤ −600 mV           | PAL Laserdisc pilot burst (IEC 60856 §9.1.2)           |
| Positive (above blanking) | ≥ +1000 mV          | Peak chroma excursions on 100% colour bars (~933 mV) plus margin |

The fixed-point domain is wide enough to carry all supported excursions without clipping during generation. All signal components — sync, burst, active video, line injections — are additively composed in fixed-point mV before final quantisation occurs.

**Output stage quantisation (fixed-point mV → 10-bit integer):**

The output stage performs a single linear mapping from the internal fixed-point mV value to a 10-bit integer code, using the normative level tables from the relevant digital interface standard. Values outside the legal code range are clamped to the standard's legal range before writing.

*PAL — EBU Tech. 3280-E (10-bit):*

$$\text{code} = \operatorname{round}\!\left(\frac{\text{mV}}{1.1905} + 256\right)$$

Normative anchors: sync tip −300 mV → code 4; blanking 0 mV → code 256; white 700 mV → code 844. Legal range: codes 4–1019.

*NTSC — SMPTE 244M-2003 (10-bit):*

$$\text{code} = \operatorname{round}\!\left(\frac{\text{mV}}{1.2755} + 240\right)$$

Normative anchors: sync tip −285.7 mV → code 16; blanking 0 mV → code 240; white 714.3 mV → code 800. Legal range: codes 16–1019.

Codes 0–3 and 1020–1023 are reserved (excluded values) per both standards and must never appear in output.

### **Current Implementation Status**

The current parser, validator, and runtime implement only a subset of the YAML surface described in this section:

- Implemented top-level presets: `video_standard_preset`, `sample_encoding_preset`, `signal_state_preset`, `ntsc_black_setup_ire`, `output.video_path`, and `output.signal_type` (`"composite"` or `"yc"`; defaults to `"composite"`). The metadata sidecar is not configured in YAML: it is always colocated with the video output and its path is derived from `output.video_path` (`.cvbs`/`.cvbsy` → `.meta`).
- `output.efm_audio` is parsed, emitted, and validated: its presence enables LaserDisc digital audio (EFM) output for the single channel pair named by `pair`. See [`efm_audio:`](#efm_audio-sub-key-optional-project-level).
- The `project:` block fields `name`, `version`, and `description` are parsed and retained on the in-memory `Project` model, so they survive load/save round-trips.
- A YAML project **emitter** (`YamlProjectEmitter` in `videosynth_core`) serialises an in-memory `Project` back to this schema. It writes fields in the canonical order shown below and emits only explicitly-set optional blocks (the project-level `line_injections:` and `disc_skips:`, and the per-section `noise:`, `dropouts:`, `osd:`, `audio:`, `line_injections:`), so emitted files stay minimal and diffable. Emit → parse is lossless: a saved file parses back to an equal `Project`, which is the contract that keeps GUI-saved projects loadable by the CLI and vice versa.
- Implemented section fields: `name`, `type`, `source`, `start_frame`, `duration_frames`, and the optional per-section `noise:`, `dropouts:`, `osd:`, and `audio:` blocks.
- The `line_injections` schema is split across two levels of the data model. A **project-level** `line_injections:` block (a sibling of `output:` and `sections:`) is parsed into a `ProjectLineInjections` value on `Project` holding the project-wide `disc_type` (`CAV`/`CLV`), the optional `placement` policy (`standard` default / `laserdisc` / `custom`, governing how VITS `target_lines` are constrained — see [VITS](#vits-vertical-interval-test-signals)), and the `vits` set (each entry a `vits_type` plus `target_lines`) applied to every frame of every section. Each **section-level** `line_injections:` list holds only `Section::LineInjection` entries (`type` plus, per type, `target_lines`/`codes`) — the per-section biphase `codes` (picture_number, chapter_number, lead_in/out, etc.) that legitimately differ between lead-in, programme, and lead-out. Both levels receive validator-level schema/compatibility checks for injection type, `target_lines`, and standard-dependent VITS constraints.
- VITS line injections have a generation-stage orchestration path and are applied only on their targeted frame lines within the owning section span.
- Built-in VITS catalog entries now carry full waveform-definition primitive/composite trees for every supported `vits_type`, so the default runtime path can render all supported PAL and NTSC VITS patterns.
- `pal_laserdisc_pilot_burst` is parsed, validated, and fully implemented: a 3.75 MHz (240 × f_H) sinusoidal burst at ±300 mV is superimposed on every sync pulse in the Y channel when enabled.
- `ntsc_laserdisc_vbi_burst` is parsed and validated for standard compatibility, but its runtime signal behavior remains deferred.

The remainder of Section 7 should therefore be read as the intended project-file design rather than the currently implemented parser surface.

#### **Asset Roots & Path Resolution**

Section `source` and `output` paths may reference a **logical asset root** with a leading `{name}` brace token, resolved to a real directory at runtime. This keeps a project portable: it references *what* an asset is, not *where* it physically lives, so projects survive reinstalls, repackaging, and moving between machines.

Built-in roots:

| Root | Meaning | Resolved location |
|------|---------|-------------------|
| `{bundled}` | Read-only assets shipped with the application | `$VIDEOSYNTH_ASSET_DIR`, else the installed `share/videosynth/assets` (found via XDG data dirs / QStandardPaths — includes Flatpak `/app/share`), else the dev `videosynth-assets/assets` directory. |
| `{user}` | The user's own writable asset library | `$XDG_DATA_HOME/videosynth/assets`, else `~/.local/share/videosynth/assets`. |
| `{project}` | The project file's own directory | Directory containing the `.yaml`. |
| `{output}` | Where this run's generated media is written | `$VIDEOSYNTH_OUTPUT_DIR` or `--output-root <path>`, else the project file's own directory. |

Resolution rules (shared by CLI and GUI via `ResolveProjectPaths` /
`ResolveAssetPath` in `path_resolution.h`), for each source/output path:

- **`{name}/rest`** → `rootDir(name) / rest` (a bare `{name}` resolves to the root directory itself). A root directory that is itself relative is anchored to the project file's directory. An **unknown** root name is a validation error.
- **Absolute or empty** → unchanged.
- **Plain relative (no token)** → the **CLI** leaves it working-directory-relative (preserving the run-from-a-base-dir convention used by the fixtures and `videosynth-assets/`); the **GUI** anchors it to the saved project file's directory so the source probe, preview, and generation resolve identically. Use `{project}/rest` for a plain relative path that must resolve the same under both.

`{output}` separates *what a project is called* from *where a particular run puts it*: a project names its artefacts relative to `{output}`, and the caller decides the directory. It defaults to the project's own directory, so a project stays self-contained when run by hand, while a batch run redirects every project at once (`scripts/run-projects.sh` sends each suite to `build/project-output/<suite>/`) and the functional test suites redirect it to a scratch directory so a test run never writes into the checked-in project tree.

The CLI seeds `{bundled}`/`{user}` from the environment and install prefix and accepts repeatable `--asset-root <name>=<path>` overrides (also usable to register additional named roots); `--output-root <path>` is shorthand for `--asset-root output=<path>`. The GUI resolves them via `QStandardPaths`. New GUI projects are saved to disk as part of the create flow so the `{project}` anchor always exists, and their default source uses `{bundled}` so a fresh project previews immediately. Newly added sections (plain and laserdisc templates alike) default to the same bundled 75% colour-bar source for the project standard's active raster rather than a placeholder file path.

Rather than expose these roots directly, the GUI section editor presents a section `source` as a two-way choice — **Built-in asset** or **Local file** — mapped onto the tokens above:

- **Built-in asset** composes `{bundled}/<type>/<raster>/<file>`, where `<type>` is the asset kind (`exr` still / `mkv` video), `<raster>` is derived from the project's video standard (720x576 PAL / 720x486 System-M, never a user field), and only `<file>` is chosen from a dropdown of the shipped assets. The path is always recomposed from the *current* project raster, so changing the video standard self-heals the source to the matching raster's asset.
- **Local file** is a browsed path stored as `{project}/…` when "Relative to project" is ticked or as an absolute path otherwise; a source already carrying another logical token (e.g. `{user}/…`) is preserved verbatim.

The compose/classify logic is a pure, Qt-free helper (`source_path_model.h`), independent of the resolution rules above.

#### **`noise:` Sub-Key (Optional, Per-Section)**

The `noise:` block enables per-section additive Gaussian noise injection targeting orc-gui Black PSNR and White SNR metrics.

| Key | Type | Required | Range | Description |
|-----|------|----------|-------|-------------|
| `noise_db` | float | Conditional | [20.0, 61.0] | Noise floor in dB; sets Black PSNR target. Required if `noise_spread_db` is present. |
| `noise_spread_db` | float | No | [0.0, `noise_db`−20.0] | White is this many dB noisier than black; White SNR target = `noise_db` − `noise_spread_db`. Defaults to 0.0. |

Rules:
- Neither key present → no noise injection (pass-through).
- Only `noise_db` present → floor-only noise; White SNR = Black PSNR = `noise_db`.
- Both present → two-component model; `noise_db − noise_spread_db ≥ 20.0` is enforced.
- `noise_spread_db` without `noise_db` → validation error.

**Lower bound (20.0 dB)**: at 20 dB, σ_noise ≈ 10 IRE ≈ 70 mV (PAL). Approaching the sync pulse amplitude; sync separator reliability degrades below this threshold.

**Upper bound (61.0 dB)**: above 61 dB, injected noise would be smaller than the 10-bit quantisation noise floor (~0.085 IRE) and would have no measurable effect in orc-gui.

#### **`dropouts:` Sub-Key (Optional, Per-Section)**

The `dropouts:` block enables per-section dropout simulation. Two independent dropout types are supported: `random` (surface/media degradation modelled as a Poisson process) and `scratch` (radial physical defect with a triangular amplitude envelope that spans multiple frames).

**`random:` block** — Poisson random dropouts:

| Key | Type | Required | Range | Description |
|-----|------|----------|-------|-------------|
| `scale` | int | Yes | [1, 20] | Severity scale. `0` disables random dropouts (equivalent to omitting the block). |
| `seed` | int | No | any int64 | Fixed RNG seed for reproducible output. If absent, a run-specific seed is used. |

**`scratch:` block** — persistent radial scratch defects:

| Key | Type | Required | Range | Description |
|-----|------|----------|-------|-------------|
| `scale` | int | Yes | [1, 20] | Severity scale. `0` disables scratch dropouts (equivalent to omitting the block). |
| `seed` | int | No | any int64 | Fixed RNG seed for reproducible output. If absent, a run-specific seed is used. |

**Scale mapping (exponential)**:

| Parameter | Scale 1 | Scale 10 | Scale 20 |
|-----------|---------|----------|---------|
| Random frequency (events/frame) | 0.05 | ~2.8 | 100 |
| Random max duration (samples) | 5 | ~282 | 2000 |
| Scratch count | 1 | 8 | 15 |
| Scratch max lifespan (frames) | 2 | ~113 | 500 |
| Scratch max peak width (samples) | 5 | ~282 | 2000 |

Rules:
- A `dropouts:` block with both `random.scale = 0` and `scratch.scale = 0` (or neither sub-block present) is a validation error — omit the `dropouts:` block entirely to disable.
- `scale` outside `[1, 20]` is a validation error.
- If `scratch.scale > 0` and the derived maximum scratch lifespan exceeds `section.duration_frames`, a **warning** is emitted (scratch events may never reach their peak amplitude within the section).

**Sidecar output**: when any section has dropout injection enabled, the pipeline creates a companion SQLite file at `<metadata_stem>.dropouts.meta` (where `<metadata_stem>` is the derived, video-colocated metadata path; schema version 5) with a single table `dropout_run(cvbs_file_id, frame_id, sample_start, sample_count, severity)`. Severity is `25` for non-visible VBI runs and `75` for runs intersecting the active picture.

Example YAML:

```yaml
sections:
  - name: "GoodLaserdisc"
    type: progressive
    source: "assets/clip.mkv"
    duration_frames: 50
    noise:
      noise_db: 50.0
    dropouts:
      random:
        scale: 5
        seed: 42
      scratch:
        scale: 3
```

---

#### **`audio:` Sub-Key (Optional, Per-Section)**

The `audio:` block declares a list of **audio channel pairs** for a section, each synthesising an independent stereo test tone for the exact duration (in frames) of that section. Following the CVBS File Format Specification (Audio Data / SMPTE 272M-1994), a project may carry up to **8 channel pairs** (0–7, i.e. up to 16 SMPTE 272M channels). Each declared channel pair is written as its own frame-locked stereo WAV track alongside the CVBS/Y-C output as `<basename>_audio_<pair>.wav` (the basename is derived from `output.video_path` by stripping a trailing `.cvbs` or `.cvbsy` suffix).

Design decisions:
- **One WAV file per channel pair** — the set of emitted pairs is the union of the pair numbers declared across all sections. Every pair file spans the whole output; a section that omits a pair emits silence for its frames, and an omitted `left`/`right` channel is stored as all-zero silence (SMPTE 272M §6.4).
- **Independent left/right channels** — each pair has separate `left:` and `right:` tone descriptors, so the two interleaved channels (odd = left, even = right) can differ or one can be silent.
- **Phase reset per section run** — each contiguous run of output frames sharing one section restarts the oscillators at phase 0; audio is a pure function of output position, so no per-frame caching is needed and the tracks stay correct under disc-skip replay.

**Frame lock** — every track is stereo, 24-bit signed little-endian PCM (RIFF/WAVE, format tag `0x0001`) at 48000 Hz, synchronous with video (SMPTE 272M §1.2). The per-frame sample count follows output position:

| Preset | `fmt` `nSamplesPerSec` | Samples/frame |
|--------|------------------------|---------------|
| `PAL` | 48000 | 1920 (constant) |
| `NTSC` | 48000 | 1602/1601 (SMPTE 272M §14.3 five-frame sequence: 1602, 1601, 1602, 1601, 1602 → 8008 per 5 frames) |
| `PAL_M` | 48000 | 1602/1601 (as NTSC) |

**`audio:` fields**:

| Key | Type | Required | Description |
|-----|------|----------|-------------|
| `channel_pairs` | list | Yes | One entry per channel pair (below). |

**`channel_pairs[]` entry**:

| Key | Type | Required | Range / Values | Description |
|-----|------|----------|----------------|-------------|
| `pair` | int | Yes | 0–7 | Channel-pair number; names the `_audio_<pair>.wav` file and the `audio_channel_pair` metadata row. Unique within a section. |
| `description` | string | No | — | Human-readable label recorded in the `audio_channel_pair` metadata (e.g. `Analogue stereo`, `Commentary`). |
| `left` | map | No\* | tone descriptor (below) | The odd (first) interleaved channel. Omitted → silent. |
| `right` | map | No\* | tone descriptor (below) | The even (second) interleaved channel. Omitted → silent. |

\* At least one of `left`/`right` must be present (a pair with no active channel is rejected by validation).

**Channel tone descriptor** (`left:` / `right:`):

| Key | Type | Required | Range / Values | Description |
|-----|------|----------|----------------|-------------|
| `waveform` | string | No | `sine`, `square`, `sawtooth`, `triangle` | Oscillator shape. Default `sine`. Waveforms are naive (non-band-limited) — acceptable for test signals. |
| `frequency` | float | No | [0, 22000] Hz | Fixed-tone frequency, used when no `ramp:` block is present. Default `1000.0`. |
| `amplitude` | float | No | [0.0, 1.0] | Peak amplitude as a fraction of full scale. Default `0.5`. |
| `ramp:` | map | No | — | Optional frequency-sweep block (below); mutually exclusive with the fixed `frequency` mode. |

**`ramp:` block** — frequency sweep:

| Key | Type | Required | Range / Values | Description |
|-----|------|----------|----------------|-------------|
| `start` | float | Yes | [0, 22000] Hz | Sweep start frequency. |
| `end` | float | Yes | [0, 22000] Hz | Sweep end frequency. |
| `mode` | string | No | `up`, `down`, `bounce` | `up` = start→end, `down` = end→start, `bounce` = start→end→start over the ramp span. Default `up`. |
| `period` | float | No | [0, section duration s] | `0` (default) sweeps once over the whole section run; `> 0` makes one sweep last this many seconds and repeat until the section ends. |

Frequency semantics: instantaneous frequency drives a phase accumulator (`phase += 2π·f(t)/fs`) so swept tones stay continuous within a section run. All frequencies (fixed and ramp `start`/`end`) must lie in `[0, 22000]` Hz — safely below the 24 kHz Nyquist limit of the 48 kHz sampling rate.

**Skip interaction**: audio follows the **output** frame stream, not the raw disc/section stream. The generator is driven with the output-order section sequence, so forward skips withhold the matching frames and backward-skip replays continue the tone at the replayed output position, preserving each track's sample-count alignment. Sections with no `audio:` block emit silence for their frame span across every pair. When at least one pair is declared, one `audio_channel_pair` row per pair (with its optional `description`) is written to the `.meta` database.

Example YAML:

```yaml
sections:
  - name: "StereoAndCommentary"
    type: progressive
    source: "assets/bars.exr"
    duration_frames: 8
    audio:
      channel_pairs:
        - pair: 0
          description: Analogue stereo
          left:  { waveform: sine, frequency: 1000.0, amplitude: 0.5 }
          right: { waveform: sine, frequency: 1000.0, amplitude: 0.5 }
        - pair: 1
          description: Commentary (left only)
          left:  { waveform: square, frequency: 440.0 }
          # right omitted -> silent
  - name: "SilenceGap"       # No audio: block — silent, but still frame-locked
    type: progressive
    source: "assets/bars.exr"
    duration_frames: 8
  - name: "SweepUp"
    type: progressive
    source: "assets/bars.exr"
    duration_frames: 8
    audio:
      channel_pairs:
        - pair: 0
          left:
            waveform: sawtooth
            amplitude: 0.5
            ramp: { start: 200.0, end: 4000.0, mode: up }
```

---

#### **`efm_audio:` Sub-Key (Optional, Project-Level)**

The `output.efm_audio:` block selects **one** audio channel pair to be additionally encoded as a LaserDisc digital audio (EFM) channel stream, written as `<basename>.efm` with a `<basename>.efm.meta` frame-index sidecar beside that pair's WAV track. The pair's WAV output and every other pair are unaffected; audio parameters (waveform, frequency, amplitude, ramps) are shared between the two paths and declared only in the per-section [`audio:`](#audio-sub-key-optional-per-section) blocks. The encoding is described in [LaserDisc Digital Audio (EFM) Output](#laserdisc-digital-audio-efm-output).

| Key | Type | Required | Range / Values | Description |
|-----|------|----------|----------------|-------------|
| `pair` | int | Yes | 0–7 | Channel pair to encode. Presence of the `efm_audio:` block is what enables the output; omit the block to disable it. |

Constraints:

- **PAL and NTSC only** — LaserDisc digital audio is defined by IEC 60856:1986 Amd 2 clause 13 (PAL) and IEC 60857:1986 Amd 2 clause 13 (NTSC); any other `video_standard_preset` is a validation error.
- **The pair must be declared** — if no section declares `pair`, a warning is emitted and no `.efm` file is written.
- **Track rules** — one track per `programme_area` section, maximum 79 (IEC 60856 Amd 2, 13.5.3.3 / IEC 60857 Amd 2, 13.6.3.3); tracks shorter than 4 s (6 s for track 1, whose first 2 s are the mandatory pause) and a project with no `lead_in` section (no TOC is emitted) produce warnings.

Example YAML:

```yaml
output:
  video_path: "out/pal_disc.cvbs"
  efm_audio:
    pair: 0
```

---

#### **`disc_skips:` Top-Level Key (Optional)**

The `disc_skips:` block simulates laserdisc player tracking failures in the generated output. Each entry describes a single skip event in terms of a disc frame position, direction, and frame count.

`disc_skips` operates on the ordered sequence of all disc frames across all sections. The pipeline processes every disc frame in sequence — including forward-skipped ones — so that `BiphaseInjectionManager.frame_count_` advances identically in all sources and `colour_frame_index`/burst phase remain consistent for a given picture number regardless of which capture sources are stacked.

| Key | Type | Required | Range | Description |
|-----|------|----------|-------|-------------|
| `at_frame` | int | Yes | [1, total_disc_frames] | 1-based disc frame number at which the skip occurs. |
| `direction` | string | Yes | `"forward"` or `"backward"` | Skip direction. |
| `count` | int | Yes | ≥ 1 | Number of frames to skip (forward) or replay (backward). |

**Forward skip** (`direction: forward`): Disc frames at 1-based positions `[at_frame, at_frame + count − 1]` are generated (advancing burst-phase state) but withheld from the output stream. The total output frame count is reduced by `count`.

**Backward skip** (`direction: backward`): After disc frame `at_frame` is written to output, the `count` frames ending at `at_frame` (i.e. 1-based `[at_frame − count + 1, at_frame]`) are re-emitted as bit-identical copies in the same order. Copies are regenerated rather than cached: synthesis (through the frame template cache), noise and dropout application are all deterministic per `(project, schedule, frame)`, so the replayed frame's noise pattern, dropout events and signal content are identical to the original. The total output frame count is increased by `count`.

**Phase-correctness invariant**: any two projects that share the same disc master will produce frames with identical burst phase and colour-frame index for a given picture number, even if each project has a different `disc_skips` pattern. This is the requirement for correct multi-source disc stacking in `decode-orc`.

Example:

```yaml
disc_skips:
  - at_frame: 5        # 1-based disc frame
    direction: forward
    count: 2           # frames 5 and 6 withheld from output (output starts at frame 7)
  - at_frame: 20
    direction: backward
    count: 4           # replay frames 17–20 as bit-identical copies after frame 20
```

---

### **File Path Resolution**

Any field in a project YAML that accepts a file path (e.g., `source` on a `progressive` section) resolves the path using the following priority order:

1. **Built-in sources** — paths prefixed with `builtin:` refer to source files bundled and installed with the application. The prefix is followed by the built-in asset name (e.g., `builtin:smpte_leader`). The application resolves these against its installation data directory at runtime, regardless of where the project YAML is located.
2. **Absolute paths** — paths beginning with `/` are used exactly as specified. The file must exist at that location on the host filesystem.
3. **Project-relative paths** — all other paths are resolved relative to the **directory containing the project YAML file**. This allows a project and its associated assets to be grouped together and moved as a unit.

The application must report a clear validation error if a referenced file cannot be found after applying these rules.

#### **Examples**

```yaml
source: "builtin:smpte_leader"        # built-in asset bundled with the application
source: "/media/archive/clip.mkv"     # absolute path
source: "assets/clip.mkv"             # relative to the project YAML directory
source: "../shared/clip.mkv"          # relative path traversal is permitted
video_path: "out/pal_test_video.cvbs" # project-relative output file path
```

---

### **Validation Rules**

1. **Single CVBS Preset**:
  - Only one `video_standard_preset` (PAL or NTSC) per project.
  - Only one `sample_encoding_preset` per project.
  - Only one `signal_state_preset` per project.
  - `output.video_path` is required in the project YAML. The metadata sidecar path is derived from it (video-colocated) and is not specified in YAML.
  - `output.signal_type` must be `"composite"` or `"yc"` (default: `"composite"`).
  - When `output.signal_type` is `"yc"`, `output.video_path` must end in `".cvbsy"`.
  - `output.signal_type` must be `"composite"` or `"yc"` (default: `"composite"`).
  - When `output.signal_type` is `"yc"`, `output.video_path` must end in `".cvbsy"`; the chroma path is derived automatically by replacing the suffix with `".cvbsc"`.
  - Output resolution is fixed by the standard (720x576 for PAL, 720x486 for NTSC) and must not be specified in the project file.
  - 4fsc generation requires a 4fsc `sample_encoding_preset` and a locked `signal_state_preset`.
  - `pal_laserdisc_pilot_burst` can **only be enabled for PAL projects**. If enabled for NTSC, the YAML is considered **invalid**.
  - `ntsc_laserdisc_vbi_burst` can **only be enabled for NTSC projects**. If enabled for PAL, the YAML is considered **invalid**.
  - `ntsc_black_setup_ire` can **only be specified for NTSC projects**. If specified for PAL, the YAML is considered **invalid**.
  - `ntsc_black_setup_ire` allowed values are `7.5` and `0.0`. `7.5` selects standards-based NTSC setup; `0.0` moves NTSC black level to blanking (`0 IRE`).
2. **Sections**:
    - Each section must have a valid `type` (`progressive`).
  - Each section must have at least one of:
      - Frame-based content (`progressive`).
    - Line injections (`line_injections`).
  - For `progressive` sections, `source` must point to a valid file.
3. **Line Injection Constraints**:
  - `target_lines` must be within the valid range for the standard (1-625 for PAL, 1-525 for NTSC).
  - `target_lines` must **not** be specified for `laserdisc` injection types; specifying it is a validation error.
  - **If injected lines overlap within a section, the YAML must fail validation.**
  - **When a `laserdisc` injection is active in a section, no other injection type may target lines within the laserdisc reserved ranges** (PAL: Field 1 lines 6–18, Field 2 lines 319–331; NTSC: Field 1 lines 10–18, Field 2 lines 273–281).
  - **A `vitc` injection and a `laserdisc` injection must not appear in the same section.** Laserdisc does not use VITC.
4. **Progressive Sources**:
  - `source` must resolve to an accessible file after applying [File Path Resolution](#file-path-resolution) rules. If the resolved path does not exist, the YAML is considered **invalid**.
  - `source` must match one of the supported progressive source profiles defined in [Section 8.1](#81-frame-based-sections); container extension alone is not sufficient.
  - For EXR sources, metadata attributes listed in [Progressive Sources](#progressive-sources) are required and validated.
  - Progressive source dimensions must be standard-consistent and exactly:
    - PAL: `720x576`
    - NTSC: `720x486`
  - Scaling/resizing is not supported. Any source outside the accepted dimensions is invalid.
  - Ingestion must not apply scaling, implicit aspect-ratio remap, or ad-hoc crop normalization.
  - `duration_frames` must be either:
    - A positive integer (fixed number of frames).
    - `"all"` (use all available frames from the source).
  - `duration_repeat` is an optional positive integer (default `1`) that replays the whole source `duration_repeat` times when `duration_frames: "all"`. Total output frames = source frame count × `duration_repeat`; each replay loops the source (source frame indices restart at 0). It is ignored — and a validation warning is emitted — when `duration_frames` is a fixed integer.

## **8. Section Types**

### **Specification Cross-Check (Section 8)**

- Progressive-source frame-rate matching to output standards is grounded in [ITU-R BT.470-6](../analogue-video-specifications/docs/video_formats/BT-470-6-1998/BT-470-6-1998.md), Annex 1, Table 1 and [SMPTE 170M-2004](../analogue-video-specifications/docs/video_formats/SMPTE-170M-2004/SMPTE-170M-2004.md) §11.3.
- Laserdisc code-type definitions and per-line placement are grounded in [IEC 60856](../analogue-video-specifications/docs/laserdisc/IEC-60856-1986-Laservision-PAL/IEC-60856-1986-Laservision-PAL.md) §10.1 and [IEC 60857](../analogue-video-specifications/docs/laserdisc/IEC-60857-1986-Laservision-NTSC/IEC-60857-1986-Laservision-NTSC.md) §10.1/§10.2, plus Amendment 2 updates for CLV picture-number behavior.
- VITC fields (`timecode`, flags, CRC) are grounded in [IEC 60461:2010](../analogue-video-specifications/docs/video_metadata/IEC-60461-2010-Time-and-control-code/IEC-60461-2010-Time-and-control-code.md) §9.2 and §9.5-§9.6.

---

### **Current Implementation Status**

- **Implemented**: `progressive` frame-based sections in Section 8.1.
- **Implemented**: Section 8.2 parser/validator constraints for VITS line-injection schema, VITS/line-allocation compatibility checks, and generation-stage VITS line application for all supported built-in PAL and NTSC VITS patterns.
- **Implemented**: Full laserdisc biphase injection for PAL and NTSC (CAV and CLV), including 24-bit biphase signal generation, 40-bit FM signal generation (NTSC), all code types (lead_in, lead_out, picture_number, picture_stop, chapter_number, programme_status, users_code, programme_time_code, clv_code, clv_picture_number, fm_picture_number, fm_programme_time, fm_white_flag), field-aware line placement, timecode continuity, chapter stop-bit logic, NTSC frozen values, NTSC CLV colour time error correction, and biphase/VITS line-conflict validation.
- **Not yet implemented**: runtime synthesis/application for VITC and custom per-line content.

For VITC and custom per-line content paths, Section 8.2 remains the intended design contract for later implementation work.

---

### **8.1. Frame-Based Sections**

These define the **primary content** for a set of frames. The current runtime supports only progressive frame sources in this section.

---

#### **Progressive Sources**

Ingests progressive sources and converts them to interlaced signals, subject to strict profile validation.

##### **Supported Source Profiles (Normative)**

Container names alone are not sufficient for validation; source files must match one of the following profiles:

- **MKV video**: Matroska container with `ffv1` video, `yuv422p10le`, standard-matching raster and frame rate (`720x576@25` PAL or `720x486@30000/1001` NTSC), and standard-matching SD field-order/color metadata.
- **EXR still image**: Single-frame OpenEXR scanline input with `R/G/B` channels in `FLOAT` (32-bit), no compression, full-raster data/display windows, standard-matching frame-rate metadata (`25/1` PAL or `30000/1001` NTSC), and matching pixel-aspect metadata.
- **BT.601 source-content compliance (required)**: accepted MKV and EXR assets must satisfy the source-content constraints documented in [MKV BT.601 Compliance Requirements](../../videosynth-assets/docs/mkv-bt601-compliance-requirements.md) and [EXR BT.601 Compliance Requirements](../../videosynth-assets/docs/exr-bt601-compliance-requirements.md), including sampling model interpretation, active-window placement, and padding expectations for the applicable profile.

Any other codec, chroma format, bit depth, or packing is outside scope and must fail validation.

##### **Fields**


| **Field**         | **Type**       | **Required** | **Description**                                                                | **Example**          |
| ----------------- | -------------- | ------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | -------------------- |
| `name`            | string         | Yes          | User-friendly name.                                                            | `"MKV Source"`       |
| `type`            | string         | Yes          | Must be `"progressive"`.                                                       | `"progressive"`      |
| `source`          | string         | Yes          | Path to the source file. May be a `builtin:` prefixed name, an absolute path, or a path relative to the project YAML. See [File Path Resolution](#file-path-resolution). | `"assets/test.mkv"` |
| `start_frame`     | integer        | No           | First frame to use (default: `0`).                                             | `0`                  |
| `duration_frames` | integer/string | No           | Number of frames to extract. Use `"all"` for all frames or a positive integer. | `100` or `"all"`     |
| `duration_repeat` | integer        | No           | Replay count when `duration_frames: "all"` (default `1`). Total frames = source length × repeat. Ignored for fixed integer durations. | `2`                  |


##### **Colour Space and Frame Rate**

- **Colour Space**: Source data is converted into 10-bit 4:4:4 YCbCr BT.601 studio swing at ingestion.
- **Frame Rate**: **Fixed by the output standard** (25 fps for PAL, ~29.97 fps for NTSC). Input sources **must match** this frame rate.
- **BT.601 content requirement**: BT.601 compliance is a source-content requirement, not only a container/metadata requirement. Source picture data must already be BT.601-consistent for its profile before ingestion.
- **10-bit studio-range preservation**:
  - MKV and EXR supported profiles must preserve studio-domain sub-black and over-white excursions when present.

##### **Accepted Dimensions and Ingestion Behavior**

- PAL progressive sources: `720x576`.
- NTSC progressive sources: `720x486`.
- Scaling or resampling is **not supported** for progressive-source ingestion. Sources must already be in one of the accepted dimensions.
- Ingestion is fail-closed on unsupported or ambiguous rasters; there is no 704-width normalization path.
- Ingestion must not crop active-picture samples, must not crop source lines, and must not rewrite horizontal padding layout. The full source raster (`720x576` or `720x486`) is preserved through ingestion.
- Expected source-profile SAR and horizontal padding semantics for accepted progressive rasters are:
  - PAL `720x576`: SAR `128:117`, padding `8-704-8`.
  - NTSC `720x486`: SAR `108:119`, padding `8-704-8`.

##### **Example**

```yaml
sections:
  - name: "MKV with VITC"
    type: progressive
    source: "/assets/test.mkv"
    duration_frames: "all"  # Use all frames from the source
    duration_repeat: 2      # Optional: play the whole source twice
    line_injections:
      - type: vitc
        target_lines: [19, 20, 21]
        timecode: "00:00:00:00"
        flags:
          drop_frame: false
          colour_frame: true
          field_flag: 1
        crc: true
```

---

---

### **8.2. Line Injections**

Line-based content to inject into the **VBI of frames**.

Line injections live at two levels:

- **Project level** — the top-level `line_injections:` block (a sibling of `output:` and `sections:`) carries the project-wide `disc_type` (`CAV`/`CLV`) and the `vits` set. The VITS set is applied to every frame of every section, so a disc's reference/test signals are declared once for the whole disc. See [VITS](#vits-vertical-interval-test-signals) below.
- **Section level** — each section's own `line_injections:` list carries the per-section `laserdisc` code injections and any `vitc` injection, i.e. content that legitimately differs between sections (lead-in vs programme vs lead-out).

---

#### **Common Fields for All Line Injections**


| **Field**      | **Type** | **Required**              | **Description**                                                                                                                                                  | **Example**    |
| -------------- | -------- | ------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------- |
| `type`         | string   | Section-level only        | Type of a section-level line injection: `laserdisc`, `vitc`, or `line_content`. (`vits` is not a section-level type — VITS is declared project-wide.)            | `"laserdisc"`  |
| `target_lines` | list     | Yes (except `laserdisc`)  | Lines to inject into (1-based, sequential across the entire frame). **Not applicable for `laserdisc` injections** — line placement is fixed by the standard.     | `[10, 11, 12]` |


---

#### **VITS (Vertical Interval Test Signals)**

VITS are a **project-level** signal set. Each VITS entry lives in the top-level `line_injections.vits` list and is applied to every frame of every section — you do not repeat it per section. For laserdisc discs this is where the mandatory NTSC `virs` reference is declared.

**Placement modes.** The optional `line_injections.placement` field selects how the validator constrains each VITS entry's `target_lines`:

- `standard` (default; also assumed when the field is absent) — each VITS type must sit on its broadcast recommended line (`vits17` → 17, `ntc7-composite` → 17, etc.). Any other line is rejected. This preserves the behaviour of projects authored before the field existed.
- `laserdisc` — VITS must sit on the laserdisc VBI lines, which are clear of the address-code ranges: **PAL** 19, 20, 332, 333 (IEC 60856 §9.1.3); **NTSC/PAL-M** 19, 20, 282, 283 (IEC 60857 §9.1.3 VIRS on 19/282, §9.1.4 composite/combination ITS on 20/283). The editor's one-click laserdisc preset seeds the spec-required set (PAL: `uk-national` on 19/332, `vits20` on 20/333; NTSC: `virs` on 19/282, `ntc7-composite` on 20, `ntc7-combination` on 283).
- `custom` — VITS may sit on any valid VBI line; the validator still rejects overlapping lines and, on a disc carrying biphase codes, the reserved address-code ranges (see §8.2 reserved-range rule).

For **VITS waveform definitions**, refer to:

- [NTSC VITS Definitions](../analogue-video-specifications/docs/video_metadata/VITS/NTSC-VITS.md)
- [PAL VITS Definitions](../analogue-video-specifications/docs/video_metadata/VITS/PAL-VITS.md)

Valid `vits_type` values depend on the active video standard. PAL types must only be used in PAL projects; NTSC types must only be used in NTSC projects.

---

#### **Laserdisc Biphase Encoding**

For **Laserdisc biphase encoding**, refer to:

- [IEC 60856](../analogue-video-specifications/docs/laserdisc/IEC-60856-1986-Laservision-PAL/IEC-60856-1986-Laservision-PAL.md) (and Amendments 1–2): Laservision PAL
- [IEC 60857](../analogue-video-specifications/docs/laserdisc/IEC-60857-1986-Laservision-NTSC/IEC-60857-1986-Laservision-NTSC.md) (and Amendments 1–2): Laservision NTSC

> **Important**: For `laserdisc` injections, **`target_lines` must not be specified**. VBI line placement is entirely determined by the standard: each code type is assigned to specific lines based on the `disc_type` and the current field identity (which field opens the picture). User-specified `target_lines` on a `laserdisc` injection will fail validation.

Laserdisc VBI encoding is a **frame-level operation**: both fields of each frame carry codes on specific lines, with many codes split across fields or placed conditionally based on which field is the first field of the picture. This field-conditional placement is intrinsic to the standard and is handled automatically by the encoder.

##### **Reserved VBI Address Ranges**

The following VBI lines are reserved exclusively for laserdisc address/data signals. No other injection type may target lines within these ranges when a `laserdisc` injection is active in the same section:

| **Standard** | **Field** | **Reserved Line Range** | **Reference**    |
| ------------ | --------- | ----------------------- | ---------------- |
| PAL          | Field 1   | 6–18                    | IEC 60856 §9.1.4 |
| PAL          | Field 2   | 319–331                 | IEC 60856 §9.1.4 |
| NTSC         | Field 1   | 10–18                   | IEC 60857 §9.1.5 |
| NTSC         | Field 2   | 273–281                 | IEC 60857 §9.1.5 |

> **PAL note**: Lines 6–15 within the Field 1 reserved range are occupied by equalizing and vertical sync pulses and carry no biphase content. The active biphase insertion lines within the reserved range are **16–18** (Field 1) and **329–331** (Field 2).
>
> **NTSC note**: Lines 10–15 are within the reserved range; lines 10–11 and 273–274 additionally carry the 40-bit FM coded signal (see below). The active 24-bit biphase insertion lines are **16–18** (Field 1) and **279–281** (Field 2). Because the reserved range spans 10–18, **NTSC NTC-7 VITS types that target lines 17 and 280 cannot coexist with a laserdisc injection** in the same section and will fail validation.

##### **Code Systems**

Two coding systems are defined:

1. **24-bit biphase coded signal** (PAL and NTSC, §10.1): The primary address/control code system. Each bit cell is 2 µs; the digital level ranges from 30% to 100% white (PAL) or 0 to 100 IRE (NTSC). The 24-bit payload is subdivided into 6 hex nibbles; the first nibble is always the key and begins with a logic-one bit.

2. **40-bit FM coded signal** (NTSC only, §10.2): An additional signal on lines 10/273 (data) and 11/274 (white flag). It provides picture number information (CAV) or programme time code (CLV) independently of the 24-bit biphase system and is always present alongside it on compliant NTSC discs.

##### **24-bit Biphase Code Types and Line Placement**

Lines are assigned per code type and field identity. "First field of picture" is the field that carries the picture number (CAV) or programme time code (CLV); "second field of picture" is the other field.

**PAL — IEC 60856 §10.1 (as amended):**

| **Code Type**              | **First-Field Lines** | **Second-Field Lines** | **Priority / Notes**                                                                                     |
| -------------------------- | --------------------- | ---------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |

| Lead-out                   | 17, 18                | 330, 331               | Both fields; ≥ 2 mm of tracks after programme end. Code: `80EEEE`                                      |

| Picture stop (CAV)         | —                     | 329, 330               | Second field only (field after picture-number field). Code: `82CFFF`; overrides programme status on 329. |
| Chapter number (CAV)       | 17, 18                | 330, 331               | Fields without picture number. Lines 17/330 are lower priority than picture stop. Code: `8X₁X₂DDD`; max 79. |
| Programme time code (CLV)  | 17, 18                | —                      | First field only. Code: `FX₁DDX₂X₃`; X₁ = hours; X₂X₃ = minutes; auto-updates each frame.             |

#### **VITC (Vertical Interval Timecode)**

> **Note**: VITC is **incompatible with laserdisc biphase encoding**. Laserdisc discs use the IEC biphase system as their sole timecode and address mechanism; VITC is not used on laserdisc and must not be combined with a `laserdisc` injection in the same section. Doing so will fail validation.

For **VITC timecode**, refer to:

- [SMPTE 12M](../analogue-video-specifications/docs/video_metadata/IEC-60461-2010-Time-and-control-code/IEC-60461-2010-Time-and-control-code.md): Vertical Interval Timecode

## **9. Field and Line Handling**

### **Specification Cross-Check (Section 9)**

- PAL/NTSC frame/field line totals and scanning relationships are grounded in [ITU-R BT.470-6](../analogue-video-specifications/docs/video_formats/BT-470-6-1998/BT-470-6-1998.md), Annex 1, Table 1 and [SMPTE 170M-2004](../analogue-video-specifications/docs/video_formats/SMPTE-170M-2004/SMPTE-170M-2004.md) §1.1/§9/§13.
- Horizontal sync width (`4.7 us`), equalizing pulse width (`2.3 us`), vertical-sync pulse block durations (`2.5H` PAL, `3H` NTSC), and burst phase conventions are grounded in [ITU-R BT.1700](../analogue-video-specifications/docs/video_formats/BT-1700-E/BT-1700-E.md), Table 2/Table 3/Figures 5/8/9, and [SMPTE 170M-2004](../analogue-video-specifications/docs/video_formats/SMPTE-170M-2004/SMPTE-170M-2004.md) §13.1-§13.3.

### **Line Numbering**

VideoSynth generates frames as **two sequential fields** written one after the other. There is no interlacing — lines are numbered and processed purely sequentially within the frame. The line numbering scheme follows the analogue standard line counts (625 for PAL, 525 for NTSC), where each line number maps directly to a position in the sequential output.

- **Lines are numbered 1 to 625 (PAL) or 1 to 525 (NTSC), sequentially across the frame in field order.**
- **Field 1** occupies the first half of the frame: lines 1–312 (PAL) or lines 1–262 (NTSC).
- **Field 2** occupies the second half of the frame: lines 313–625 (PAL) or lines 263–525 (NTSC).
- **VBI Lines**: Lines 1–22 (PAL) and 1–21 (NTSC) in each field are the VBI region available for metadata injection (e.g., VITS, VITC, Laserdisc biphase).

> **Note**: This numbering is the generator's internal sequential line addressing. It does not imply anything about how the signal is displayed on an analogue monitor — the analogue receiver is responsible for interpreting the two sequential fields as an interlaced image. VideoSynth itself performs no interlacing.

### **Progressive Source to Two-Field Frame Conversion**

When ingesting a progressive source, the generator splits each progressive frame into **two fields** and writes them sequentially into the output frame. This is a spatial line-splitting operation — not interlacing. The output is two fields in sequence, each containing half the source lines.

1. **Split Fields**:
  - For a progressive source frame of height `H`:
    - **Field 1**: Odd source lines (1, 3, 5, ..., H-1), written sequentially as lines 1, 2, 3, ... of Field 1.
    - **Field 2**: Even source lines (2, 4, 6, ..., H), written sequentially as lines 1, 2, 3, ... of Field 2.
  - **PAL Example (720×576 progressive source)**:
    - Field 1: source lines 1, 3, 5, ..., 575 → 288 lines.
    - Field 2: source lines 2, 4, 6, ..., 576 → 288 lines.
  - **NTSC Example (720×486 progressive source)**:
    - Field 1: source lines 1, 3, 5, ..., 485 → 243 lines.
    - Field 2: source lines 2, 4, 6, ..., 486 → 243 lines.
2. **Field Order**:
  - **PAL**: Field 1 is always written first, then Field 2.
  - **NTSC**: Field 1 is written first, then Field 2 (native 29.97 fps sources).
3. **Field Dominance**:
  - **PAL**: Field 1 is **temporally first** (dominant).
  - **NTSC**: Field 2 is **temporally first** for 3:2 pulldown sequences (24 fps sources).

### **Sync and Burst Insertion**

For **HSync, VSync, and colour burst insertion**, refer to:

- [ITU-R BT.470-6](../analogue-video-specifications/docs/video_formats/BT-470-6-1998/BT-470-6-1998.md)
- [ITU-R BT.1700](../analogue-video-specifications/docs/video_formats/BT-1700-E/BT-1700-E.md)

1. **Horizontal Sync (HSync)**:
  - Insert a **4.7 µs pulse at 0V** at the start of each line.
  - Followed by **back porch (0.3V)** and **colour burst (2.25 µs, 0.3V p-p)**.
  - **PAL**: Burst phase polarity follows the BT.1700 Table 1 item 10f sequence (I/II/III/IV over colour fields), with nominal **±135°** phase per line and sequence-dependent odd/even polarity assignment.
  - **NTSC**: Burst phase follows continuous-subcarrier line progression (line-to-line $\pi$ alternation at 4fsc in the current implementation).
2. **Vertical Sync (VSync)**:
  - **PAL**:
    - **Lines 623-625**: 5 broad pulses (2.5H each) with equalizing pulses.
    - **Equalizing Pulses**: 5 pulses before/after VSync (2.3 µs each).
  - **NTSC**:
    - **Lines 523-525**: 3 broad pulses (3H each) with equalizing pulses.
    - **Equalizing Pulses**: 6 pulses before/after VSync (2.3 µs each).
  - **PAL burst blanking during vertical interval**: burst suppression windows follow BT.1700 Figure 8 sequence windows:
    - Sequence I: lines 623–625 and 1–6.
    - Sequence II: lines 310–318.
    - Sequence III: lines 622–625 and 1–5.
    - Sequence IV: lines 311–319.
3. **PAL Laserdisc Pilot Burst** (when `pal_laserdisc_pilot_burst: true`):
  - Superimpose a continuous **3.75 MHz** ($240 \times f_H$) sinusoidal burst on the **sync pulse level** of every horizontal and vertical sync pulse in every line (see [IEC 60856](../analogue-video-specifications/docs/laserdisc/IEC-60856-1986-Laservision-PAL/IEC-60856-1986-Laservision-PAL.md) §9.1.2).
  - Amplitude: $\frac{6}{7} \times 700\ \text{mV} = 600\ \text{mV p-p}$, centred on sync tip (−300 mV), so the burst swings between **−600 mV and 0 mV**.
  - The pilot burst is applied to the full duration of every sync pulse (line-sync, broad/vertical sync, and equalizing pulses).
  - $17\,734\,475 = 25 \times 709\,379$, so the pilot advances a whole number of cycles per PAL frame and its waveform is identical on every frame. The runtime therefore derives each burst's phase from its offset **within** the frame — not from the absolute sample index — and renders every burst of the frame once per run.
  - This extends the signal range 300 mV below standard sync tip; see §6.1 for the headroom rationale and the required internal floating-point representation.
4. **NTSC Laserdisc VBI Burst** (when `ntsc_laserdisc_vbi_burst: true`):
  - Insert the standard NTSC **colour burst (3.579545 MHz)** on the back porch of **equalizing pulses and broad (field) sync pulses** during the vertical interval, where burst is normally suppressed in standard NTSC (see [IEC 60857](../analogue-video-specifications/docs/laserdisc/IEC-60857-1986-Laservision-NTSC/IEC-60857-1986-Laservision-NTSC.md) §9.1.2).
  - The burst uses the same amplitude and phase as regular NTSC colour burst; no new frequency or amplitude is introduced.
  - This applies to all equalizing pulse and broad sync pulse lines in both Field 1 (lines 1–9) and Field 2 (lines 263–271).

### **4fsc Sampling Modes**


Current implementation status:

- Only **locked `4fsc`** operation is implemented.
- The current runtime does **not** implement a free-running mode.
- The current runtime does **not** expose a separate NCO-driven sample-clock subsystem; instead it synthesizes carrier phase directly from the absolute sample index on the `4fsc` lattice. Because the carrier advances exactly $\pi/2$ per sample, the index is reduced modulo 4 before the phase is formed, which makes the phase exact for any render length instead of losing precision as the absolute index grows.


| **Mode**                 | **Description**                                                                                                                  | **Use Case**                                                                         | **Reference**                     |
| ------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------- |
| **Locked to Subcarrier** | Sample clock is **phase-locked** to the colour subcarrier (e.g., 4 × f_sc) using an **NCO (Numerically Controlled Oscillator)**. | Studio applications, testing, or when phase coherence is critical.                   | SMPTE 244M-2003, EBU Tech. 3280-E |
| **Free-Running**         | Sample clock runs **independently** of the subcarrier (e.g., 17.734475 MHz for PAL, but not locked).                             | General-purpose generation, emulation, or when subcarrier alignment is not required. | SMPTE 244M-2003, EBU Tech. 3280-E |

### **Subcarrier Lock Implementation**

For **testing applications**, the subcarrier locking implementation **must meet or exceed** the phase accuracy specified in the PAL/NTSC standards. The current implementation achieves lock implicitly by synthesizing Y/C directly on the `4fsc` sample lattice; a dedicated NCO-based clocking subsystem remains a target design for future extension to alternate sampling modes.

- **Current sampled-domain lock model**:
  - Use the normative `4fsc` sample rate for the selected standard.
  - Derive burst and active-picture carrier phase from the absolute sample index so line-to-line phase progression follows the standard-specific `4fsc` geometry. The index is reduced onto the 4-sample subcarrier lattice and the resulting phase bounded to $[0, 2\pi)$, so the arguments handed to the trigonometric functions never grow with render length.
  - Preserve whole-frame sample counts defined by the active standard (`709,379` PAL, `477,750` NTSC).

- **Future extension target**:
  - Introduce an explicit **NCO** or equivalent phase-accumulator abstraction when unlocked modes or alternate sample-rate outputs are implemented.
  - Demonstrate **≤ ±1° phase error** and suitable frequency accuracy relative to the ideal subcarrier-locked rate.

---

### **YAML Configuration**

```yaml
cvbs_presets:
  sample_encoding_preset: CVBS_U10_4FSC
  signal_state_preset: STANDARD_TBC_LOCKED
```

---

### **Implementation Notes**

- **Current runtime**:
  - Generate complete frame batches directly at `4 × f_sc`.
  - Use absolute-sample-index carrier synthesis for PAL/NTSC burst and active-picture chroma.
  - Reject non-locked and non-`4fsc` output requests during validation.
- **Future runtime extensions**:
  - Add explicit unlocked and non-`4fsc` output modes behind a dedicated sample-clock abstraction.

## **11. VBI Line Allocation**

### **Specification Cross-Check (Section 11)**

- PAL laserdisc reserved ranges and address-signal constraints are grounded in [IEC 60856](../analogue-video-specifications/docs/laserdisc/IEC-60856-1986-Laservision-PAL/IEC-60856-1986-Laservision-PAL.md) §9.1.4 and Clause 10.
- NTSC laserdisc reserved ranges and 40-bit FM coexistence are grounded in [IEC 60857](../analogue-video-specifications/docs/laserdisc/IEC-60857-1986-Laservision-NTSC/IEC-60857-1986-Laservision-NTSC.md) §9.1.5, §10.1, §10.2.
- VIRS/ITS line assignments for NTSC laserdisc are grounded in [IEC 60857](../analogue-video-specifications/docs/laserdisc/IEC-60857-1986-Laservision-NTSC/IEC-60857-1986-Laservision-NTSC.md) §9.1.3-§9.1.4.
- PAL amendment-specific alternates (e.g., added CLV picture-number behavior and alternate VBI usage) are grounded in [IEC 60856 Amendment 2](../analogue-video-specifications/docs/laserdisc/IEC-60856-1986-Laservision-PAL-Amendment-2/IEC-60856-1986-Laservision-PAL-Amendment-2.md) §9.1.3/§9.1.4/§10.1.10.
- NTSC amendment-specific CLV/FM updates are grounded in [IEC 60857 Amendment 2](../analogue-video-specifications/docs/laserdisc/IEC-60857-1986-Laservision-NTSC-Amendment-2/IEC-60857-1986-Laservision-NTSC-Amendment-2.md) §10.1.10 and §10.2.3.
- VITC location constraints used for conflict checks are grounded in [IEC 60461:2010](../analogue-video-specifications/docs/video_metadata/IEC-60461-2010-Time-and-control-code/IEC-60461-2010-Time-and-control-code.md) §9.6.2 and §9.6.3.

VBI line allocations differ between PAL and NTSC and between Laserdisc and non-Laserdisc use. The laserdisc standards define exclusive reserved ranges that must not overlap with any other injection type.

Current implementation status:

- The runtime synthesizes sync, burst, blanking, and active-picture placement.
- VITS line injections are fully implemented for all supported PAL and NTSC types.
- Laserdisc biphase injection is fully implemented for PAL and NTSC (CAV and CLV), including 24-bit biphase and 40-bit FM coded signals, all code types, field-aware line placement, and all associated validation rules.
- VITC and custom per-line content runtime paths remain deferred; the VBI allocation rules for those injection types in this section are target design constraints for future implementation.

### **Conflict Resolution**

- **If injected lines overlap within a section, the YAML must fail validation.**
- **When a `laserdisc` injection is active in a section, any other injection targeting lines within the reserved range for that standard must fail validation** (PAL: F1 6–18, F2 319–331; NTSC: F1 10–18, F2 273–281).
- **A `vitc` injection and a `laserdisc` injection must not appear in the same section.** Laserdisc does not use VITC; the biphase system is the sole timecode and address mechanism on laserdisc.

The runtime uses a **central pipeline module** to process sections and combine them into the final output. The pipeline controls schedule construction, batched generation, streamed output writes, and progress logging, and is divided into the **Generation Stage** and **Output Stage**.

### **Pipeline Overview**

```
[YAML Project File] → [Validation] → [Pipeline Controller (schedule + progress)] → [Generation Stage (batched frames)] → [Noise Injection Stage (per-section)] → [Dropout Injection Stage (per-section)] → [Output Stage (append + finalize)] → [CVBS File (Video + Metadata) + Dropout Sidecar (.dropouts.meta)]
```

### **Pipeline Entry Points and Concurrency**

- `VideoSynthPipeline::Run(options, observer, cancellation)` parses the YAML project file and delegates to `RunProject`. `VideoSynthPipeline::RunProject(project, options, observer, cancellation)` runs the pipeline for an already-parsed in-memory `Project` (validate → generate → noise → dropout → output); relative paths in the project are used as-is and must be resolved by the caller. The CLI uses `Run`; front-ends that hold an in-memory project (e.g. a GUI) use `RunProject`.
- `observer` (optional, nullable) is an `IPipelineObserver` receiving stage transitions (`validate`, `generate`, `finalize`), per-batch frame progress (`frames_completed / frames_total`), validation warnings, and a terminal `PipelineRunStatus` (`kSucceeded` / `kCancelled` / `kFailed`) reported exactly once. Callbacks run synchronously on the pipeline's executing thread.
- `cancellation` (optional, nullable) is a thread-safe one-shot `CancellationToken` polled between frame batches (and per disc frame in the skip-aware loop). On cancellation the pipeline aborts all in-progress artefacts — video/chroma/metadata via `IOutputStage::AbortWrite`, the WAV tracks via `AudioTrackGenerator::Abort`, and the dropout sidecar via `DropoutInjectionStage::Abort` — so a cancelled run leaves no partially-written output files, reports `kCancelled` (not an error), and returns `false`.
- A whole pipeline run executes on a single thread, which may be a worker thread; there is no main-thread affinity. `ILogger`, `IProjectParser`, and `IProjectValidator` implementations are thread-safe; the stage collaborators are single-owner and NOT thread-safe, so a pipeline instance must not run concurrently with itself.

---

### **Detailed Pipeline Steps**

#### **1. Validation Stage**

- Parse the YAML file and validate all fields.
- In the current runtime, validate the implemented subset of fields and constraints only.
- Ensure the selected `signal_state_preset` denotes locked operation when using a 4fsc `sample_encoding_preset`.
- For progressive assets, enforce source-profile and BT.601 source-content compliance requirements defined in [Section 8.1](#81-frame-based-sections) and the referenced asset-spec documents.
- **Fail validation if any errors are found.**

#### **2. Generation Stage**

- **Input**: Validated YAML project file.
- **Output**: `4fsc`-discrete fixed-point representations of **luma (Y)** and **chroma (C)** signals.
- **Steps**:
  1. For each section:
    - Generate the **frame-based content** (`progressive`) from source data that already satisfies BT.601 source-content constraints.
    - Preserve source raster geometry during ingestion (no scaling, no resampling, and no crop of samples or lines).
    - For each frame in the section:
      - Insert **sync pulses** and **colour burst** (see [ITU-R BT.470-6](../analogue-video-specifications/docs/video_formats/BT-470-6-1998/BT-470-6-1998.md), [ITU-R BT.1700](../analogue-video-specifications/docs/video_formats/BT-1700-E/BT-1700-E.md)).
      - Apply **ramping and transition smoothing** to simulate analogue behavior (see [ITU-R BT.470-6](../analogue-video-specifications/docs/video_formats/BT-470-6-1998/BT-470-6-1998.md) for ramping requirements).
    - Emit bounded batches of `4fsc` Y and C sample buffers in fixed-point mV units, ready for handoff to the Noise Injection Stage.

Current implementation note:

- VITS line injections are applied in the generation-stage runtime path on validated target lines.
- Laserdisc biphase injection is applied in the generation-stage runtime path via BiphaseInjectionManager (24-bit biphase and 40-bit FM for NTSC).
- Runtime synthesis/application for VITC and custom per-line content remains deferred.
- When `disc_skips` is non-empty the pipeline switches to a **skip-aware work item path** instead of the normal batched loop. A `ComputeDiscSkipPlan` pre-pass builds one `DiscFrameAction` per disc frame from the skip declarations — whether the frame is written to output, and the disc frames to re-emit after it — and `BuildDiscWorkItems` expands that plan into the item sequence a run processes: every disc frame in order, each followed by its backward-skip replays. Each item records the disc frame to synthesise, whether it is emitted, and whether it commits the frame's dropout sidecar rows. Forward-skipped frames are still synthesised (so disc state advances) but not written. Backward-skip copies are **regenerated** through the generation stage — whose frame template cache makes the clean-frame portion a copy — rather than replayed from a second whole-frame cache in the pipeline: synthesis, noise, and dropout application are all deterministic per `(project, schedule, frame)`, so a regenerated frame is byte-identical to its first emission. A replayed frame's dropout sidecar rows were committed when it was first processed, so the recomputed rows are discarded (only the signal push is applied again). `BeginWrite` receives the actual output frame count (which may differ from `total_disc_frames`).
- Because items are independent, a skip project uses the **same worker pool** as any other project when `--threads` is greater than 1: items are synthesised out of order and consumed in item order, which is what keeps the emitted samples, the sidecar row order and the frame-locked audio identical to a single-threaded run.

#### **3. Noise Injection Stage**

- **Input**: `4fsc`-discrete fixed-point Y/C mV batches from the generation stage; project noise parameters per section.
- **Output**: In-place modified Y/C mV buffers with additive Gaussian noise applied to sections that have `noise.enabled == true`.
- **Steps**:
  1. For each frame in the batch, look up the owning section from the frame schedule.
  2. Skip frames whose section has no noise configured.
  3. For each enabled frame:
     - Derive floor sigma (`σ_f_mV`) and proportional coefficient (`k`) from `noise_db` and `noise_spread_db`.
     - Seed `std::mt19937_64` from a hash of `(section_index, global_frame_index)` for reproducible, batch-size-independent output.
     - For each sample position: draw a single noise value and add it to both Y and C buffers (correlated noise). The noise standard deviation at each sample is `sqrt(σ_f² + (k × Y_mV)²)`.
  4. Clamp all output samples to the legal fixed-point mV range for the standard.

#### **4. Dropout Injection Stage**

- **Input**: In-place fixed-point Y/C mV batches (after noise); project dropout parameters per section.
- **Output**: In-place modified Y/C mV buffers with random and/or scratch dropouts applied; `<basename>.dropouts.meta` SQLite sidecar populated.
- **Steps**:
  1. On first call (`Begin`), open the sidecar SQLite file at the path derived from the (video-colocated) metadata path (`.meta` → `.dropouts.meta`). Create the `dropout_run` table (schema version 5) and begin a single transaction.
  2. For each frame in the batch:
     - Determine owning section; skip if no dropout type is active.
     - **Scratch pass**: for each pre-computed scratch event, apply the triangular amplitude/width envelope at the current frame index; record covered intervals.
     - **Random pass**: draw `N ~ Poisson(frequency)` random events; clip each event against scratch-covered intervals; merge adjacent residuals; apply signal push.
     - For each surviving run: split at active-picture boundaries; apply `lerp(original_mV, target_mV, push_fraction)` to both Y and C; write `dropout_run` row with `severity = 75` (visible) or `25` (non-visible).
  3. Clamp all modified samples to the legal fixed-point mV range.
  4. On `Finalize`, commit the transaction and close the database handle.
  5. If no section has dropout injection enabled, the sidecar is not created.

#### **5. Output Stage**

- **Input**: `4fsc`-discrete Y and C signal batches from the generation stage.
- **Output**: CVBS file (video + metadata).
- **Steps**:
  1. **Generate Metadata**:
    - Create the CVBS file header with all required metadata (see [CVBS File Format Specification](../cvbs-file-format-specification/docs/index.md)).
  2. **Composite Formation and Quantisation** (composite mode) / **Y/C Quantisation** (Y/C mode):
    - **Composite** (`signal_type: composite`): Combine the fixed-point luma and chroma sample buffers into a composite sample stream; encode to the active output preset representation.
    - **Y/C** (`signal_type: yc`): Encode luma samples identically to composite luma; encode chroma samples centred at code 512 per the CVBS File Format Specification (§ Sample Encoding Presets); write to separate `.cvbsy` and `.cvbsc` files.
    - In both modes, map fixed-point mV samples to 10-bit integers using the normative linear mapping for the active standard (EBU Tech. 3280-E for PAL, SMPTE 244M-2003 for NTSC). See [§6.1](#61-signal-levels) for the formulae.
    - Clamp to the legal code range; excluded values (codes 0–3 and 1020–1023) must not appear in output.
  3. **mV to Integer Conversion**:
    - Encode the quantised composite code stream into the active output preset representation.
  4. **Output Formatting**:
    - Append each generated batch directly to the **video file** as it completes.
    - Finalize by writing metadata to the **metadata file** once all expected frames have been written.

Current implementation note:

- The output stage currently accepts only locked `4fsc` batches and does not perform a separate resampling or NCO-driven sampling step.

### **Ramping and Transition Smoothing**

To simulate **analogue output**, the generator must:

- Avoid **sharp transitions** in the signal.
- Apply **ramping** to sync pulses, colour burst, and active video transitions as specified in [ITU-R BT.470-6](../analogue-video-specifications/docs/video_formats/BT-470-6-1998/BT-470-6-1998.md) and [ITU-R BT.1700](../analogue-video-specifications/docs/video_formats/BT-1700-E/BT-1700-E.md).
- **Rise/Fall Times**:
  - **Luma**: 140 ns ± 20 ns (10% to 90% of white level) (see [SMPTE 170M-2004](../analogue-video-specifications/docs/video_formats/SMPTE-170M-2004/SMPTE-170M-2004.md)).
  - **Chroma**: 200 ns ± 50 ns (10% to 90% of chroma amplitude) (see [SMPTE 170M-2004](../analogue-video-specifications/docs/video_formats/SMPTE-170M-2004/SMPTE-170M-2004.md)).

### **Current Implementation Status**

The current validator enforces a narrower subset than the full design intent in this section:

- Implemented: standard selection, locked `4fsc` preset constraints, output-path requirements (including `signal_type` validation and `.cvbsy`-suffix enforcement for Y/C mode), progressive source profile checks, accepted raster checks, NTSC black-setup constraints, and validator-side VITS/line-injection compatibility checks including overlap detection, laserdisc reserved-range conflicts, and VITC/laserdisc incompatibility.
- Implemented: full laserdisc biphase validation including section_type/code_type matrix enforcement, IEC value range constraints (picture_number, chapter_number, users_code X₁, CLV picture number digits, programme time code BCD), CAV minimum duration checks (lead-in ≥ 938 frames, lead-out ≥ 1250 frames), minimum chapter length (30 tracks), the NTSC VIRS mandatory presence check (a `virs` entry in the project-level `line_injections.vits`), and VITS/biphase reserved-range line conflict detection.
- Implemented: per-section noise parameter validation (range, spread floor, mutual dependency).
- Implemented: disc-structure section ordering. When any section declares a `section_type`, the section sequence must be `[lead_in] programme_area... [lead_out]`: at most one `lead_in` (first) and one `lead_out` (last), no section may precede the `lead_in` or follow the `lead_out`, and every section after a `lead_in` or before a `lead_out` must be `programme_area`. Out-of-order sections would break monotonic picture-number and time-code generation (IEC 60856/60857). The GUI surfaces these errors through the shared validator in the validation issues dock.
- Not yet implemented in the validator/runtime pair: VITC and custom per-line content runtime paths.

The rule set below remains the intended validation contract for VITC and custom per-line content, which are not yet implemented.

---

### **Validation Rules**

1. **CVBS Presets**:
  - Only one `video_standard_preset` (PAL or NTSC) per project.
  - Only one `sample_encoding_preset` per project.
  - Only one `signal_state_preset` per project.
  - Output resolution is fixed by the standard (720x576 for PAL, 720x486 for NTSC) and must not be specified in the project file.
  - 4fsc generation requires a 4fsc `sample_encoding_preset` and a locked `signal_state_preset`.
  - `pal_laserdisc_pilot_burst` can **only be enabled for PAL projects**. If enabled for NTSC, the YAML is considered **invalid**.
  - `ntsc_laserdisc_vbi_burst` can **only be enabled for NTSC projects**. If enabled for PAL, the YAML is considered **invalid**.
  - `ntsc_black_setup_ire` can **only be specified for NTSC projects**. If specified for PAL, the YAML is considered **invalid**.
  - `ntsc_black_setup_ire` must be either `7.5` or `0.0`.
2. **Sections**:
  - Each section must have a valid `type` (`progressive`).
  - Each section must have at least one of:
    - Frame-based content (`progressive`).
    - Line injections (`line_injections`).
  - For `progressive` sections, `source` must point to a valid file.
  - **Input source frame rate must match the required output format (including MKV sources)**.
  - **Progressive source must match a supported source profile (container + codec + pixel format/bit depth as applicable)**.
  - **Progressive source content must satisfy the BT.601 source-content requirements defined by the referenced asset specifications in Section 8.1 (including active-window placement/padding semantics for the applicable profile).**
  - **Progressive source dimensions must be PAL: `720x576`; NTSC: `720x486`**.
  - **Scaling/resizing of progressive sources is not supported**.
  - **Ingestion must preserve the full source raster geometry (`720x576` or `720x486`) with no horizontal crop, no vertical crop, and no sample-rate conversion.**
  - **Ingestion must not apply implicit width normalization or ad-hoc crop/remap operations**.
  - **Disc-structure section ordering** (applies when any section declares a `section_type`):
    - At most one `lead_in` section; if present, it must be the **first** section (no section may precede it).
    - At most one `lead_out` section; if present, it must be the **last** section (no section may follow it).
    - Every section after a `lead_in` or before a `lead_out` must be `programme_area`.
    - Violations are **errors**: out-of-order sections would break monotonic picture-number and time-code generation (IEC 60856/60857).
3. **Line Injection Constraints**:
  - `target_lines` must be within the valid range for the standard (1-625 for PAL, 1-525 for NTSC).
  - `target_lines` must **not** be specified for `laserdisc` injection types; specifying it is a validation error.
  - **If injected lines overlap within a section, the YAML must fail validation.**
  - **When a `laserdisc` injection is active in a section, no other injection type may target lines within the laserdisc reserved ranges** (PAL: Field 1 lines 6–18, Field 2 lines 319–331; NTSC: Field 1 lines 10–18, Field 2 lines 273–281).
  - **A `vitc` injection and a `laserdisc` injection must not appear in the same section.** Laserdisc does not use VITC.
4. **Noise Parameters** (per-section `noise:` block):
  - `noise_db` must be in **[20.0, 61.0] dB** (error if outside this range).
  - `noise_spread_db` must be **≥ 0.0** (error if negative).
  - `noise_db − noise_spread_db` must be **≥ 20.0** (White SNR floor limit; error if violated).
  - `noise_spread_db` present without `noise_db` is a validation error.
  - If `noise_spread_db > 0` and no VITS injection targets the orc-gui White SNR measurement line (PAL: frame line 19; NTSC: frame line 20), a **warning** is emitted that the White SNR target will not be verifiable in orc-gui without a suitable VITS white-flag injection.
5. **Dropout Parameters** (per-section `dropouts:` block):
  - `random.scale` must be in **[0, 20]** (error if outside this range; `0` means disabled).
  - `scratch.scale` must be in **[0, 20]** (error if outside this range; `0` means disabled).
  - A `dropouts:` block where both `random.scale` and `scratch.scale` are `0` (or both sub-blocks are absent) is a **validation error** — omit the `dropouts:` key entirely to disable.
  - If `scratch.scale > 0` and the derived maximum scratch lifespan (from `DeriveScratchDropoutParams(scale).max_dur_frames`) exceeds `section.duration_frames`, a **warning** is emitted indicating the scratch event will not complete its full triangle envelope within the section.
6. **Disc Skip Parameters** (`disc_skips:` top-level list):
  - Each entry's `at_frame` must be in **[1, total_disc_frames]** where `total_disc_frames` = sum of all section `duration_frames`.
  - Each entry's `count` must be **≥ 1**.
  - For `direction: forward`: `at_frame + count − 1` must be **≤ total_disc_frames** (the skip range must not extend beyond the last disc frame).
  - For `direction: backward`: `at_frame − count + 1` must be **≥ 1** (the replay range must not extend before the first disc frame).
  - `direction` must be one of `"forward"` or `"backward"`; any other value is a validation error.
7. **EFM Digital Audio** (`output.efm_audio:` block):
  - `pair` must be in **[0, 7]** (error if outside this range).
  - `video_standard_preset` must be `PAL` or `NTSC` — no other standard has a LaserDisc digital audio specification (error otherwise).
  - If no section declares the selected `pair`, a **warning** is emitted: no `.efm` file is written.
  - More than **79** `programme_area` sections is an error (IEC 60856 Amd 2, 13.5.3.3 / IEC 60857 Amd 2, 13.6.3.3 — one track per section).
  - A `programme_area` section shorter than **4 s** (**6 s** for the first, whose leading 2 s are the mandatory pause) emits a **warning** (IEC 60908-1999, 17.5.1).
  - A project with no `lead_in` section emits a **warning**: no table of contents is emitted.

## **14. CLI Interface**

### **Specification Cross-Check (Section 14)**

- This section defines application interface behavior (non-normative to analogue waveform standards).
- `--validate` behavior is intended to enforce constraints traced to Sections 7, 11, and 13 (which are normatively tied to BT.470/1700, SMPTE 170M/244M, IEC 60856/60857, IEC 60461).

---

### **Usage**

```bash
videosynth --project project.yaml [options]
```

---

### **Options**


| **Option**   | **Description**                                   | **Default** |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------------------- | ----------- |
| `--project`  | Path to the YAML project file (required).         | -           |
| `--validate` | Validate the YAML file without generating output. | `false`     |
| `--version`  | Print the build version (short git commit hash, `-dirty` suffix for modified trees, or the release override string) and exit. | -           |
| `--threads <n>` | Frame synthesis worker threads: `auto` (one per hardware thread) or a positive integer. `1` selects the pure sequential path. Output is byte-identical regardless of the thread count, including for projects with `disc_skips`. | `auto` |
| `--template-cache-mb <n>` | Frame template cache capacity in MiB; `0` disables the cache (see [Section 4](#4-generation-stage), Frame Template Cache). Output is byte-identical regardless of the capacity. | `512` |
| `--log-level <level>` | Set the log level to `info`, `debug`, or `trace`. | `info` |
| `--log-file <filename>` | Write log output to the specified file in addition to the console. | none |

The output path is configured in YAML under `output.video_path`; the metadata sidecar and audio track are colocated with it.

Multi-threaded generation splits frame processing into a sequential
schedule-enrichment pass (per-frame VBI code words, colour-sequence indices,
OSD token strings) followed by order-independent per-frame sample synthesis on
a worker pool; frames are reassembled in order (bounded to 2 × thread count
in-flight frames) before output, dropout-sidecar, and audio emission, so all
emitted artefacts match the sequential path byte for byte.

Workers carry as much of the per-frame work as ordering allows. Besides
synthesis, noise and dropout computation, each worker also **encodes** its
frame into output sample codes (`IOutputStage::EncodeFrame`, a const function
of the session state resolved by `BeginWrite`), leaving the single consumer
thread with one `write` per file per frame plus the sidecar and audio
bookkeeping that must happen in order. Frame buffers are recycled through a
free list sized to the reassembly window, so steady-state generation allocates
no whole-frame buffers and peak resident memory stays bounded by that window
rather than by allocator churn.

---

### **Example**

```bash
# Generate CVBS output from a project file
videosynth --project pal_test.yaml

# Validate a project file without generating output
videosynth --project ntsc_test.yaml --validate

# Generate on the pure sequential path (single-threaded)
videosynth --project pal_test.yaml --threads 1

# Generate with debug logging and a log file
videosynth --project pal_test.yaml --log-level debug --log-file out/videosynth.log

### **GUI logging options**

`videosynth-gui` accepts the same `--log-level <level>` and `--log-file
<filename>` options (both `--option value` and `--option=value` forms). They
configure the application logger — which also receives Qt's own diagnostics
via the message bridge — and, for the lifetime of the session, override the
persisted generation preferences for every pipeline run started from the GUI.
When the options are absent, the application logger stays at `info` on stderr
and generation runs follow the Preferences dialog settings. An invalid level
or missing value exits with code 2, matching the CLI.

```bash
# Run the GUI with trace logging captured to a file
videosynth-gui --log-level trace --log-file out/videosynth-gui.log
```

## **15. Build and Packaging**

### **Specification Cross-Check (Section 15)**

- This section is implementation/tooling guidance and does not introduce analogue waveform constants.
- No additional normative analogue-spec clauses are required here beyond those already referenced in design requirements sections.

---

### **Build Environment**

- **Language**: C++17.
- **Build System**: Nix.
- **Dependencies**:
  - **YAML Parsing**: [yaml-cpp](https://github.com/jbeder/yaml-cpp).
  - **Image/Video Decoding**: [FFmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/) (for the constrained progressive source profiles in Section 8.1).
  - **Sample Rate Conversion**: [soxr](https://sourceforge.net/p/soxr/).
  - **Logging**: [spdlog](https://github.com/gabime/spdlog).
  - **Testing**: [Google Test](https://github.com/google/googletest).

### **Nix Configuration**

#### `**flake.nix` Example**

```nix
{
  description = "VideoSynth - Analogue Video Format Generator";

  inputs = {
    nixpkgs.url = "github:NixOS/nixpkgs/nixos-unstable";
    flake-utils.url = "github:numtide/flake-utils";
  };

  outputs = { self, nixpkgs, flake-utils }:
    flake-utils.lib.eachDefaultSystem (system:
      let
        pkgs = import nixpkgs { inherit system; };
      in {
        packages.default = pkgs.stdenv.mkDerivation {
          name = "videosynth";
          src = ./.;

          buildInputs = with pkgs; [
            cmake
            yaml-cpp
            ffmpeg
            soxr
            spdlog
            googletest
          ];

          cmakeFlags = [ "-DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release" ];

          installPhase = ''
            mkdir -p $out/bin
            cp videosynth $out/bin/
          '';
