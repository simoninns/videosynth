# Audio

videosynth synthesises frame-locked audio test tones alongside the video. A project may carry up to **eight stereo channel pairs** (0–7, i.e. up to sixteen SMPTE 272M channels), each written as its own WAV track, and one of those pairs may additionally be encoded as laserdisc EFM digital audio.

Audio is a pure function of output position, so every track stays sample-accurately locked to the video regardless of what the sections are doing.

## Channel pairs

Audio is declared per section, one entry per channel pair:

```yaml
sections:
  - name: StereoAndCommentary
    type: progressive
    source: "{bundled}/exr/720x576/75_BARS.exr"
    duration_frames: 250
    audio:
      channel_pairs:
        - pair: 0
          description: Analogue stereo
          left:  { waveform: sine, frequency: 1000.0, amplitude: 0.5 }
          right: { waveform: sine, frequency: 1000.0, amplitude: 0.5 }
        - pair: 1
          description: Commentary (left only)
          left:  { waveform: square, frequency: 440.0 }
          # right omitted -> silent
```

The rules:

- **One WAV file per pair.** The set of files written is the union of the pair numbers declared anywhere in the project. Every pair file spans the whole output.
- **A section that omits a pair emits silence for its frames**, still frame-locked. There are no gaps in a track.
- **Left and right are independent.** Either may be omitted and stored as silence; at least one must be present.
- **Oscillator phase resets per section run.** Each contiguous run of frames sharing one section restarts its oscillators at phase 0.

## Frame lock

Every track is stereo, 24-bit signed little-endian PCM (RIFF/WAVE) at 48 000 Hz, synchronous with the video per SMPTE 272M §1.2. The per-frame sample count follows the standard:

| Standard | Samples per frame |
|----------|-------------------|
| PAL | 1920 (constant) |
| NTSC / PAL-M | 1602/1601 in the SMPTE 272M §14.3 five-frame sequence — 1602, 1601, 1602, 1601, 1602 → 8008 per 5 frames |

## Tones

Each channel carries a tone descriptor:

| Key | Values | Default |
|-----|--------|---------|
| `waveform` | `sine`, `square`, `sawtooth`, `triangle` | `sine` |
| `frequency` | 0–22 000 Hz | 1000.0 |
| `amplitude` | 0.0–1.0 of full scale | 0.5 |
| `ramp` | A frequency sweep block (below) | — |

Waveforms are naive rather than band-limited, which is appropriate for test signals — a square wave should look like a square wave, aliasing and all.

The 22 kHz ceiling keeps every tone safely under the 24 kHz Nyquist limit of the 48 kHz sample rate.

## Frequency ramps

A `ramp:` block replaces the fixed `frequency` with a sweep:

```yaml
        - pair: 0
          left:
            waveform: sawtooth
            amplitude: 0.5
            ramp: { start: 200.0, end: 4000.0, mode: up }
```

| Key | Values | Meaning |
|-----|--------|---------|
| `start` | 0–22 000 Hz | Sweep start |
| `end` | 0–22 000 Hz | Sweep end |
| `mode` | `up`, `down`, `bounce` | `up` = start→end, `down` = end→start, `bounce` = start→end→start |
| `period` | seconds | `0` (default) sweeps once over the whole section; `> 0` makes one sweep last this long and repeat |

Instantaneous frequency drives a phase accumulator, so swept tones stay phase-continuous within a section run.

A `ramp:` block and a fixed `frequency` are mutually exclusive.

## Output files

Each declared pair is written beside the video as:

```text
<basename>_audio_<pair>.wav
```

where `<basename>` is `output.video_path` with its trailing `.cvbs` or `.cvbsy` removed. When at least one pair is declared, one `audio_channel_pair` row per pair — with its `description` — is written to the `.meta` sidecar.

## Laserdisc EFM digital audio

A laserdisc's digital audio channel can be generated from one of the pairs:

```yaml
output:
  video_path: "{output}/pal_disc.cvbs"
  efm_audio:
    pair: 0
```

The presence of the `efm_audio:` block is what enables it. That pair is synthesised a second time at exactly 44 100 Hz — the laserdisc digital audio rate (IEC 60856/60857 Amd 2 clause 13.2), with no resampling — and encoded as an IEC 60908 EFM channel stream. Its 48 kHz WAV track and every other pair are untouched; the tone parameters are shared and declared only in the per-section `audio:` blocks.

### What gets written

```text
<basename>.efm        the channel stream, one byte per pit/land run length (T3-T11)
<basename>.efm.meta   a SQLite frame index: one row per video frame
```

Both share the CVBS basename, so the channel pair number is not part of either name. An aborted run leaves neither file behind.

### Disc structure drives track layout

EFM track layout is derived from `section_type`, not from the biphase codes:

| Section type | EFM content |
|--------------|-------------|
| `lead_in` | The repetitive mode-4 table of contents — one POINT per track plus A0/A1/A2 |
| `programme_area` | One track per contiguous run of frames sharing that section, numbered 01, 02, … in output order |
| `lead_out` | Lead-out subcode (TNO = AA) |

Because it depends only on `section_type`, a project can produce a proper EFM disc **without carrying any biphase codes at all** — which keeps the lead-in short. A CAV biphase lead-in would have to run for at least 938 frames; an EFM-only lead-in can be a couple of seconds.

### Constraints

| Rule | Severity |
|------|----------|
| `pair` must be 0–7 | Error |
| Standard must be PAL or NTSC — no other system has a laserdisc digital audio specification | Error |
| At most 79 `programme_area` sections (one track each) | Error |
| No section declares the selected pair → no `.efm` is written | Warning |
| A `programme_area` section shorter than 4 s (6 s for the first, whose leading 2 s are the mandatory pause) | Warning |
| No `lead_in` section → no table of contents is emitted | Warning |

### Timing

Time zero is common to video frame 0, WAV sample 0, EFM source sample 0 and Q absolute time 00:00:00. The only structural delay is the CIRC interleave — 108 F1 frames, about 14.69 ms — and the stream is deliberately *not* pre-compensated for it, so the shared datum with the video and WAV timelines holds. A complementary decoder emits that much warm-up silence and is then sample-exact against the source.
