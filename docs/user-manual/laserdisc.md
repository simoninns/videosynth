# Laserdisc discs

videosynth can generate complete laserdisc-style discs: a lead-in, a programme area and a lead-out, carrying the IEC 60856 (PAL Laservision) and IEC 60857 (NTSC Laservision) VBI address and control codes that a player reads to know where it is on the disc.

This page explains how a disc project is put together. The exact fields for each code type are in the [laserdisc code reference](../reference/laserdisc-codes.md).

## What the codes do

Every field of a compliant disc carries a **24-bit biphase-modulated code** on reserved VBI lines. NTSC discs additionally carry a **40-bit FM code** on separate lines. Between them they tell the player:

- the current picture number (CAV) or elapsed programme time (CLV);
- which chapter is playing, and whether it is a valid search-stop point;
- whether it is in the lead-in, the programme, or the lead-out;
- the programme status — audio mode, CX noise reduction, copy permission;
- when to freeze on a still frame.

## Disc structure

A disc is expressed as sections carrying a `section_type`:

| `section_type` | Purpose | Minimum duration |
|----------------|---------|------------------|
| `lead_in` | Before the programme; the player spins up and synchronises here | 938 frames |
| `programme_area` | The content | — |
| `lead_out` | After the programme; signals the end of the disc | 1250 frames |

The minimum durations come from the track pitch: IEC requires 1.5 mm of track before the programme and 2 mm after it, which at 1.6 µm per track works out at 938 and 1250 frames. videosynth enforces them.

Section order is validated. Once any section declares a `section_type`, the sequence must be `[lead_in] programme_area… [lead_out]`:

- at most one `lead_in`, and nothing may precede it;
- at most one `lead_out`, and nothing may follow it;
- everything between them must be `programme_area`.

Out-of-order sections would break monotonic picture-number and time-code generation, so this is an error rather than a warning.

## CAV or CLV

The disc format is a **project-wide** setting, because a disc is entirely one or the other:

```yaml
line_injections:
  disc_type: CAV        # or CLV
```

| | CAV | CLV |
|---|-----|-----|
| Rotation | Constant angular velocity | Constant linear velocity |
| Addressing | Picture number, one frame per track | Programme time code + CLV picture number |
| Playing time | ~30 min per side (PAL) | ~60 min per side (PAL) |
| Still frame | Native — one frame per revolution | Limited |
| Chapter skip | Frame-accurate | Time-based |

The disc format decides which code types are legal. Setting `disc_type` changes the code checklist in the GUI and the set the validator will accept.

## Declaring codes

Codes are declared per section, because they legitimately differ between disc areas:

```yaml
sections:
  - name: Programme
    type: progressive
    source: "{bundled}/exr/720x576/100_BARS.exr"
    duration_frames: 250
    section_type: programme_area
    line_injections:
      - type: laserdisc
        codes:
          - code_type: picture_number
            start_value: 1
          - code_type: chapter_number
            chapter: 1
          - code_type: programme_status
            programme_status: "0x8DC000"
```

!!! important "You never choose VBI lines"
    `target_lines` must **not** appear on a `laserdisc` injection — specifying it is a validation error. Line placement is entirely determined by the standard from the code type, the disc format, and which field opens the current picture. videosynth works it out per frame.

## Which codes go where

Only certain code types are legal in each section type. These matrices are what the validator enforces.

### CAV

| Code type | `lead_in` | `programme_area` | `lead_out` |
|-----------|:---------:|:----------------:|:----------:|
| `lead_in` | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ |
| `lead_out` | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ |
| `picture_number` | ❌ | ✅ | ❌ |
| `picture_stop` | ❌ | ✅ | ❌ |
| `chapter_number` | ❌ | ✅ | ❌ |
| `programme_status` | ❌ | ✅ | ❌ |
| `users_code` | ✅ | ❌ | ✅ |
| `fm_picture_number` (NTSC) | ❌ | ✅ | ❌ |
| `fm_white_flag` (NTSC) | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |

### CLV

| Code type | `lead_in` | `programme_area` | `lead_out` |
|-----------|:---------:|:----------------:|:----------:|
| `lead_in` | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ |
| `lead_out` | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ |
| `programme_time_code` | ❌ | ✅ | ❌ |
| `clv_code` | ❌ | ✅ | ❌ |
| `clv_picture_number` | ❌ | ✅ | ❌ |
| `chapter_number` | ❌ | ✅ | ❌ |
| `programme_status` | ❌ | ✅ | ❌ |
| `users_code` | ✅ | ❌ | ✅ |
| `fm_programme_time` (NTSC) | ❌ | ✅ | ❌ |
| `fm_white_flag` (NTSC) | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |

## Timecode continuity

IEC 60856/60857 §10.1.5 requires timecodes to run **continuously** from the first frame of the programme area to the last, without resetting for any reason.

videosynth enforces this for you. The `picture_number`, `programme_time_code` and `clv_picture_number` counters persist across every section boundary and keep incrementing. The CLV clocks have nothing to configure at all — they run from the start of the output.

For `picture_number`, the rule is simply: **set `start_value` on the first programme section and omit it thereafter.**

```yaml
# First programme section — anchor the numbering.
- name: Chapter0
  section_type: programme_area
  line_injections:
    - type: laserdisc
      codes:
        - code_type: picture_number
          start_value: 1
        - code_type: chapter_number
          chapter: 0

# Later section — numbering continues automatically.
- name: Chapter1
  section_type: programme_area
  line_injections:
    - type: laserdisc
      codes:
        - code_type: picture_number     # no start_value
        - code_type: chapter_number
          chapter: 1
```

Setting `start_value` on a later section **re-anchors** the count there. That is a deliberate discontinuity — useful for modelling a player skip or a replayed passage, and wrong for ordinary chapter boundaries. Chapter changes never reset a timecode.

### NTSC frozen values

On NTSC discs, timecodes are frozen outside the programme area:

| Section | Picture number | Programme time |
|---------|----------------|----------------|
| Lead-in | 0 (frozen) | 0:00 (frozen) |
| Programme area | Incrementing | Incrementing |
| Lead-out | Frozen at the last programme value | Frozen at the last programme value |

This is handled automatically.

## Chapters

Chapters are numbered 0–79, with a minimum length of 30 tracks (30 frames on CAV). One chapter marker per programme-area section.

```yaml
- code_type: chapter_number
  chapter: 3
```

Omitting `chapter` continues the previous section's chapter, carrying its stop-bit track counter across the boundary. Setting it starts a new chapter, restarting that counter.

### The stop-bit

Every chapter code carries a **stop-bit** telling the player whether it may stop at this chapter during a search:

| Position within the chapter | Stop-bit |
|-----------------------------|----------|
| Tracks 0–399 | 0 — search passes through |
| Track 400 onwards | 1 — search may stop |
| Any track of a chapter shorter than 800 tracks | 1 |
| The first chapter after the lead-in | Always 1 |

videosynth computes and encodes this for you from the chapter number and the track position; you only ever supply the chapter number.

## Programme status

The programme status code carries audio/video mode and copy permission, with a SECDED Hamming check digit:

```yaml
- code_type: programme_status
  programme_status: "0x8DC000"
```

The value encodes:

- **Nibbles 1–2** — `DC` for CX noise reduction on, `BA` for off.
- **X₃** — disc size, disc side, teletext presence and copy permission bits.
- **X₄** — audio/video mode (0–3 standard, 8 = mono dump).
- **X₅** — Hamming check, computed automatically.

The GUI has a **Programme Status Code** dialog that composes the word from readable fields and shows the resulting hex, which is considerably easier than assembling it by hand.

## The NTSC 40-bit FM system

NTSC discs carry two parallel encoding systems, and a compliant disc has both:

| System | Lines | Carries |
|--------|-------|---------|
| 24-bit biphase | 16–18 (field 1), 279–281 (field 2) | The primary address and control codes, shared with PAL |
| 40-bit FM | 10, 273 (data); 11, 274 (white flag) | Picture number or programme time, independently |

To enable it, add the FM code types alongside the 24-bit ones:

```yaml
codes:
  - code_type: picture_number
    start_value: 1
  - code_type: fm_picture_number      # NTSC CAV
  - code_type: fm_white_flag
```

or, on a CLV disc, `fm_programme_time` in place of `fm_picture_number`.

### The white flag

`fm_white_flag` is a constant 100 IRE signal on line 11 or 274 marking the start of each new picture — the player uses it to decide what a "frame" is when holding a still. It is placed on the field that opens the picture, and **deferred automatically** when consecutive fields are identical (as with telecine or a freeze), so it always marks a genuinely new picture. Nothing about this needs configuring.

## Line placement

For reference, this is where each code type actually lands. You do not configure any of it.

### PAL CAV

| Code type | Field 1 | Field 2 |
|-----------|---------|---------|
| `picture_number` | 17, 18 | 330, 331 |
| `picture_stop` | 16, 17 | 329, 330 |
| `chapter_number` | 17, 18 (where no picture number) | 330, 331 |
| `programme_status` | 16 | 329 |
| `users_code` | 16 | 329 |

### PAL CLV

| Code type | Field 1 | Field 2 |
|-----------|---------|---------|
| `programme_time_code` | 17, 18 | 330, 331 |
| `clv_code` | 17 | 330 |
| `clv_picture_number` | 16 | 329 |
| `chapter_number` | 18 | 331 |
| `programme_status` | 16 | 329 |
| `users_code` | 16 | 329 |

### NTSC CAV

| Code type | Field 1 | Field 2 |
|-----------|---------|---------|
| `fm_picture_number` | 10 | 273 |
| `fm_white_flag` | 11 | 274 |
| `picture_number` | 17, 18 | 280, 281 |
| `picture_stop` | 16, 17 | 279, 280 |
| `chapter_number` | 17, 18 | 280, 281 |
| `programme_status` | 16 | 279 |
| `users_code` | 16 | 279 |

### NTSC CLV

| Code type | Field 1 | Field 2 |
|-----------|---------|---------|
| `fm_programme_time` | 10 | 273 |
| `fm_white_flag` | 11 | 274 |
| `programme_time_code` | 17, 18 | 280, 281 |
| `clv_code` | 17 | 280 |
| `clv_picture_number` | 16 | 279 |
| `chapter_number` | 18 | 281 |
| `programme_status` | 16 | 279 |
| `users_code` | 16 | 279 |

Where two code types would collide, priority is fixed by the standard: lead-in and lead-out codes win outright in their sections; `picture_stop` beats `programme_status`; `programme_time_code` beats `chapter_number`; `clv_picture_number` beats `chapter_number`; and `chapter_number` yields to `picture_number`.

`programme_status` (both standards) and `clv_code` (NTSC) start 0.172H into the active line rather than at its start, per IEC 60856 Figure 14 / IEC 60857 Figure 11. This offset is applied automatically.

## What else a disc needs

- **VITS on the laserdisc lines.** The broadcast VITS lines collide with the reserved code ranges, so use `placement: laserdisc`. NTSC discs *must* carry `virs` — see [VITS](vits.md).
- **The pilot burst.** PAL discs carry a 3.75 MHz burst on every sync pulse (`pal_laserdisc_pilot_burst: true`), which needs a signed or raw [sample encoding](video-signal.md#sample-encodings) to avoid clipping.
- **No VITC.** Laserdisc uses the IEC biphase system as its sole timecode mechanism, and a `vitc` injection alongside a `laserdisc` one is a validation error. (VITC is not implemented at all in the current runtime, so the question does not arise in practice.)
- **EFM digital audio**, optionally — see [Audio](audio.md). Note that `section_type` alone drives the EFM disc-area mapping, so a project can have an EFM lead-in without carrying biphase codes at all.
