# `sections[].dropouts`

Per-section dropout simulation. Optional — omit the block entirely to disable dropouts.

```yaml
    dropouts:
      random:
        scale: 5
        seed: 42
      scratch:
        scale: 3
        seed: 42
```

## Keys

| Key | Type | Required | Description |
|-----|------|----------|-------------|
| `random` | map | No | Poisson random dropouts (below) |
| `scratch` | map | No | Persistent radial scratch defects (below) |

At least one must be present and non-zero. No other key is accepted.

### `random`

Surface and media degradation, modelled as a Poisson process — short losses scattered across the picture, independent frame to frame.

| Key | Type | Required | Range | Description |
|-----|------|----------|-------|-------------|
| `scale` | int | Yes | 1–20 | Severity. `0` disables, equivalent to omitting the block |
| `seed` | int | No | any int64 | Fixed RNG seed. Omit for a run-specific seed |

### `scratch`

A persistent physical defect: it appears, grows to a peak severity and fades away over a run of frames — a triangular amplitude envelope — so it spans many consecutive frames rather than flickering.

| Key | Type | Required | Range | Description |
|-----|------|----------|-------|-------------|
| `scale` | int | Yes | 1–20 | Severity. `0` disables |
| `seed` | int | No | any int64 | Fixed RNG seed |

## Severity scale

`scale` is a severity level, not a physical unit. The mapping is exponential:

| Parameter | Scale 1 | Scale 10 | Scale 20 |
|-----------|---------|----------|----------|
| Random events per frame | 0.05 | ~2.8 | 100 |
| Random maximum duration (samples) | 5 | ~282 | 2000 |
| Scratch count | 1 | 8 | 15 |
| Scratch maximum lifespan (frames) | 2 | ~113 | 500 |
| Scratch maximum peak width (samples) | 5 | ~282 | 2000 |

## Rules

| Rule | Severity |
|------|----------|
| `scale` outside 1–20 | Error |
| A `dropouts:` block with both scales at 0, or with neither sub-block present | Error — omit the block instead |
| Derived maximum scratch lifespan longer than `duration_frames` | Warning: scratch events may never reach peak amplitude |

The "disable by omission, not by zeroing" rule exists so that a block that looks like it configures something always does.

## The dropout sidecar

When any section has dropouts enabled, the pipeline writes a companion SQLite database:

```text
<basename>.dropouts.meta      schema version 5
```

with a single table:

```sql
dropout_run(cvbs_file_id, frame_id, sample_start, sample_count, severity)
```

`severity` is `25` for runs entirely within the non-visible VBI and `75` for runs intersecting the active picture.

This is ground truth — every dropout videosynth introduced, with its exact extent — so a dropout detector or concealer can be scored directly against it.
