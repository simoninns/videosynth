# The project file

A videosynth project is a single YAML file. This reference documents it block by block; each page covers one block, its keys, their types and ranges, and the rules the validator applies.

## Top-level structure

There are exactly five top-level blocks. Any other top-level key is a parse error.

```yaml
project:          # Identity — name, version, description
cvbs_presets:     # Signal format — standard, encoding, signal state
output:           # Where the media goes and in what form
line_injections:  # Project-wide disc format and VITS set
sections:         # The ordered timeline
```

| Block | Required | Page |
|-------|----------|------|
| `project` | No | [project](project.md) |
| `cvbs_presets` | Yes | [cvbs_presets](cvbs-presets.md) |
| `output` | Yes | [output](output.md) |
| `line_injections` | No | [line_injections](line-injections.md) |
| `sections` | Yes | [sections](sections.md) |

## Section blocks

Each entry in `sections:` may carry these optional sub-blocks:

| Sub-block | Purpose | Page |
|-----------|---------|------|
| `line_injections` | Laserdisc biphase codes for this section | [section line_injections](section-line-injections.md) |
| `noise` | Gaussian noise injection | [noise](section-noise.md) |
| `dropouts` | Random and scratch dropouts | [dropouts](section-dropouts.md) |
| `osd` | On-screen display overlays | [osd](section-osd.md) |
| `audio` | Audio channel pairs | [audio](section-audio.md) |

## Value catalogues

| Reference | Contents |
|-----------|----------|
| [Laserdisc code types](laserdisc-codes.md) | Every `code_type`, its fields and constraints |
| [VITS types](vits-types.md) | Every `vits_type` per standard |
| [Asset roots](asset-roots.md) | `{bundled}`, `{user}`, `{project}`, `{output}` and path resolution |
| [CLI options](cli-options.md) | Command-line reference |

## A minimal project

The smallest project that generates anything:

```yaml
cvbs_presets:
  video_standard_preset: PAL
  sample_encoding_preset: CVBS_U10_4FSC
  signal_state_preset: STANDARD_TBC_LOCKED

output:
  video_path: "{output}/out.cvbs"

sections:
  - name: Bars
    type: progressive
    source: "{bundled}/exr/720x576/100_BARS.exr"
    duration_frames: 25
```

## Canonical key order

videosynth can write projects as well as read them, and the emitter uses a fixed key order. A project saved by the GUI comes back in this shape, which keeps files diffable. Hand-written projects need not follow it — order is not significant to the parser — but matching it avoids gratuitous diffs the first time a file passes through the GUI.

```yaml

  name:
  version:

        - pair:
          description:
          left:
            waveform:
            frequency:
            amplitude:
            ramp:
              start:
              end:
              mode:
              period:
          right:
```

Only explicitly-set optional blocks are emitted, so a saved file stays minimal. Emit → parse is lossless: a saved project parses back to an identical project, which is the contract that keeps GUI-saved projects loadable by the CLI and vice versa.

## Unknown keys are errors

Every block validates its key set. An unrecognised key is reported by name, along with the block it appeared in:

```text
section contains unsupported field: 'duration_frame'.
cvbs_presets contains unsupported field: 'field_order'.
```

This is deliberate. A silently ignored typo in a signal-generation tool produces a plausible-looking file that is quietly wrong, which is worse than a failure.
